.Sh NAME
.Nm strlcpy ,
.Nm strlcat
.Nd size-bounded string copying and concatenation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn strlcpy "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t size"
.Ft size_t
.Fn strlcat "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat
functions copy and concatenate
.Tn NUL Ns -terminated
strings respectively.
.Pp
The
.Fn strlcpy
function computes the length
.Pq like Xr strlen 3
of
.Fa src ,
which
.Em MUST
be
.Tn NUL Ns -terminated ,
and copies up to
.Fa size Li "- 1"
bytes from
.Fa src
to
.Fa dst ,
.Tn NUL Ns -terminating
the result.
.Pp
If the bytes
.Fa dst Ns Li "[0]" ,
.Fa dst Ns Li "[1]" ,
\&...\^,
.Fa dst Ns Li "[" Ns Fa size Li - 1 Ns Li "]"
are all
.No non- Ns Tn NUL ,
then the
.Fn strlcat
function returns
.Sm off
.Fa size Li \~+\~ strlen( Fa src )
.Sm on
without writing anything to
.Fa dst .
.Pp
Otherwise, the
.Fn strlcat
function computes the sum of the lengths of
.Fa dst
and
.Fa src ,
which
.Em MUST
be
.Tn NUL Ns -terminated ,
and copies the content of
.Fa src
to the position of the first
.Tn NUL
byte in
.Fa dst ,
.Tn NUL Ns -terminating
the result.
.Fn strlcat
will append at most
.Sm off
.Fa size Li \~-\~ strlen( Fa dst ) Li \~-\~ 1
.Sm on
.No non- Ns Tn NUL
bytes from
.Fa src ,
followed by one
.Tn NUL
byte.
.Ss Relation to Xr strncpy 3 and Xr strncat 3
Unlike
.Xr strncpy 3 ,
.Fn strlcpy
is guaranteed to
.Tn NUL Ns -terminate
the result
.Po
as long as
.Fa size
is larger than 0
.Pc .
Note that you should include a byte for the
.Tn NUL
in
.Fa size .
.Pp
Unlike
.Xr strncat 3 ,
.Fn strlcat
is guaranteed to
.Tn NUL Ns -terminate
the result if
.Fa dst
is
.Tn NUL Ns -terminated
to begin with.
.
.Bl -hang -width 0n \" indent by just the extra spacing (digit-width)
.
.It Sy WARNING :
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat
are not guaranteed to initialize all
.Fa size
bytes of
.Fa dst .
.Fn strlcpy
leaves bytes past
.Sm off
.Fa dst Li "[" strlen( Fa src ) Li "]"
.Sm on
uninitialized, and
.Fn strlcat
leaves bytes past
.Sm off
.Fa dst Li "[" strlen( Fa dst ) Li \~+\~ strlen( Fa src ) Li "]"
.Sm on
uninitialized.
This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as leaking secrets from
uninitialized stack or heap buffers.
You
.Em MUST NOT
simply replace
.Xr strncpy 3
and
.Xr strncat 3
by
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat
without proving it is safe to leave some of the output uninitialized.
.
.It Sy WARNING :
.Fn strlcat
does not guarantee to
.Tn NUL Ns -terminate
.Fa dst
even if there is space for it.
In particular, if
.Fa dst
is not
.Tn NUL Ns -terminated
on entry, then
.Fn strlcat
will leave it without a
.Tn NUL Ns -terminator
on return.
.
.It Sy WARNING :
The
.Fa src
argument
.Em MUST
be
.Tn NUL Ns -terminated .
Both
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat
will read through
.Fa src
until they find a
.Tn NUL
terminator, reading
.Fa src Ns Li "[" Ns Fa size Ns Li "]" Ns ,
.Fa src Ns Li "[" Ns Fa size Li + 1 Ns Li "]" Ns ,
.Fa src Ns Li "[" Ns Fa size Li + 2 Ns Li "]" Ns ,
and beyond if there was no earlier
.Tn NUL
terminator.
Applications handling fixed-width fields with
.Pq possibly empty
.Tn NUL
padding, instead of
.Tn NUL Ns -terminated
C strings,
.Em MUST
use
.Xr strncpy 3
and
.Xr strncat 3
instead.
Attempting to use
.Fn strlcpy
or
.Fn strlcat
for these cases can lead to crashes or security vulnerabilities from
buffer overruns.
.
.El
.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat
functions return the total length of the string they tried to create.
For
.Fn strlcpy
that means the length of
.Fa src .
For
.Fn strlcat
that means the initial length of
.Fa dst
plus
the length of
.Fa src .
While this may seem somewhat confusing it was done to make
truncation detection simple.
.Pp
Note however, that if
.Fn strlcat
traverses
.Fa size
bytes without finding a
.Tn NUL ,
the length of the string is considered to be
.Fa size
and the destination string will not be
.Tn NUL Ns -terminated
.Pq since there was no space for the Tn NUL .
This keeps
.Fn strlcat
from running off the end of a string.
In practice this should not happen
.Po
as it means that either
.Fa size
is incorrect or that
.Fa dst
is not a proper
.Dq C
string
.Pc .
The check exists to prevent potential security problems in incorrect code.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment illustrates the simple case:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char *s, *p, buf[BUFSIZ];

\&...

strlcpy(buf, s, sizeof(buf));
strlcat(buf, p, sizeof(buf));
.Ed
.Pp
To detect truncation, perhaps while building a pathname, something
like the following might be used:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char *dir, *file, pname[MAXPATHLEN];

\&...

if (strlcpy(pname, dir, sizeof(pname)) >= sizeof(pname))
        goto toolong;
if (strlcat(pname, file, sizeof(pname)) >= sizeof(pname))
        goto toolong;
.Ed
.Pp
Since we know how many bytes we copied the first time, we can
speed things up a bit by using a copy instead of an append:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char *dir, *file, pname[MAXPATHLEN];
size_t n;

\&...

n = strlcpy(pname, dir, sizeof(pname));
if (n >= sizeof(pname))
        goto toolong;
if (strlcpy(pname + n, file, sizeof(pname) - n) >= sizeof(pname) - n)
        goto toolong;
.Ed
.Pp
However, one may question the validity of such optimizations, as they
defeat the whole purpose of
.Fn strlcpy
and
.Fn strlcat .
