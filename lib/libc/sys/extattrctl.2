.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm extattrctl
.Nd control extended attributes on a UFS1 filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/extattr.h
.In ufs/ufs/extattr.h
.Ft int
.Fn extattrctl "const char *path" "int cmd" "const char *attrname" "int attrnamespace" "const char *filename"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn extattrctl
system call provides low-level control over extended attributes on a UFS1
filesystem.
It allows enabling, disabling, and managing extended attributes.
.Pp
Since was no provision in the UFS1 filesystem for attributes,
they are stored as regular files and directories in the filesystem under the
.Pa "/.attribute"
directory.
By convention, are usually two directories directly under, separating two
namespaces:
.Dq user
and
.Dq system .
Under these, named attributes that can be created and managed using
.Xr extattrctl 8 .
.Pp
This programming interface is currently only used by
.Xr extattrctl 8 ,
and is not intended for general use.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fa path
The path to the mount point of the filesystem.
.It Fa cmd
The command to execute.
Valid commands are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv UFS_EXTATTR_CMD_ENABLE
Enable a specific extended attribute.
.It Dv UFS_EXTATTR_CMD_DISABLE
Disable a specific extended attribute.
.It Dv UFS_EXTATTR_CMD_START
Start extended attribute support on the filesystem.
.It Dv UFS_EXTATTR_CMD_STOP
Stop extended attribute support on the filesystem.
.El
.It Fa attrname
The name of the extended attribute (for relevant commands).
.It Fa attrnamespace
The attribute namespace, such as
.Dv EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_USER
or
.Dv EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_SYSTEM .
.It Fa filename
The path to a backing file for extended attribute storage
(if required by the command).
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn extattrctl
returns
.Dv 0 .
Otherwise,
.Dv -1
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Enable an attribute on a filesystem:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <sys/extattr.h>
#include <ufs/ufs/extattr.h>

if (extattrctl("/home", UFS_EXTATTR_CMD_ENABLE,
    "comment", EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_USER,
    "/.attribute/user/comment") == -1)
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, "extattrctl");
