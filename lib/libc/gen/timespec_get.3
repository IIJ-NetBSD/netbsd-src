.Dt TIMESPEC_GET 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm timespec_get ,
.Nm timespec_getres
.Nd get current calendar time
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In time.h
.Ft int
.Fn timespec_get "struct timespec *ts" "int base"
.Fn timespec_getres "struct timespec *ts" "int base"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn timespec_get
function sets the interval pointed to by
.Fa ts
to hold the current calendar time based on the specified time base in
.Fa base .
It is the ISO C equivalent to the POSIX function
.Xr clock_gettime 2 .
.Pp
The base
.Dv TIME_UTC
returns the time since the epoch.
This time is expressed in seconds and nanoseconds since midnight (0 hour), January 1, 1970.
In
.Nx ,
this corresponds to
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME .
.Pp
The base
.Dv TIME_MONOTONIC
returns the seconds and nanoseconds since an implementation-defined reference
point in such a way that a second call will never return a value less than the
first.
In
.Nx ,
this corresponds to
.Dv CLOCK_MONOTONIC .
.Pp
The resolution of each timer can be queried using
.Fn timespec_getres .
Each successive call to this function will return the same value for a
specific clock.
It is the ISO C equivalent to the POSIX function
.Xr clock_getres 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions returns the passed value of
.Fa base
if successful, otherwise 0 on failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr clock_gettime 2 ,
.Xr gettimeofday 2 ,
.Xr time 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn timespec_get
function with a
.Fa base
of
.Dv TIME_UTC
conforms to
.St -isoC-2011 .
The
.Fa base
of
.Dv TIME_MONOTONIC
is specified in
.St -isoC-2023 .
.Pp
The
.Fn timespec_getres
function conforms to
.St -isoC-2023 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn timespec_get
function first appeared in
.Nx 8.0 .
.Pp
The
.Fn timespec_getres
function first appeared in
.Nx 11.0 .
