.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions draw borders around
.Va stdscr
or around the specified window.
.Pp
The
.Fn border
function draws a border around
.Va stdscr
using the characters given as arguments to the function.
The
.Fa ls ,
.Fa rs ,
.Fa ts
and
.Fa bs
are the characters used to draw the left, right, top and bottom sides,
respectively.
The
.Fa tl ,
.Fa tr ,
.Fa bl
and
.Fa br
are the characters used to draw the top-left, top-right, bottom-left
and bottom-right corners, respectively.
If any of the characters have a text portion that is 0 then a default
alternate character set character is used for that character.
Note that even though the text portion of the argument is 0, the argument
can still be used to specify the attributes for that portion of the border.
The following table shows the default characters for each argument:
.Pp
.Bl -column "ls" -offset indent
.It ls	ACS_VLINE
.It rs	ACS_VLINE
.It ts	ACS_HLINE
.It bs	ACS_HLINE
.It tl	ACS_ULCORNER
.It tr	ACS_URCORNER
.It bl	ACS_LLCORNER
.It br	ACS_LRCORNER
.El
.Pp
.Fn wborder
is the same as
.Fn border
excepting that the border is drawn around the specified window.
.Pp
The
.Fn box
command draws a box around the window given in
.Fa win
using the
.Fa vertical
character for the vertical lines and the
.Fa horizontal
character for the horizontal lines.
The corner characters of this box will be the defaults as described for
.Fn border
above.
Passing characters with text portion that is 0 to
.Fn box
will result in the same defaults as those for
.Fn border
as described above.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions returning pointers will return
.Dv NULL
if an error is detected.
The functions that return an int will return one of the following
values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ERR -compact
.It Er OK
The function completed successfully.
.It Er ERR
An error occurred in the function.
.El
