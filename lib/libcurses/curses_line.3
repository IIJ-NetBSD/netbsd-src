.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions draw lines on
.Va stdscr
or on the specified window.
.Pp
The
.Fn hline
function draws a horizontal line of the character
.Fa ch
on
.Va stdscr
starting at the current cursor position and extending for
.Fa n
characters, or until the right hand side of
.Va stdscr
is reached.
If the text portion of
.Fa ch
is 0 then the line will be drawn with the
.Dv ACS_HLINE
character.
.Pp
The
.Fn whline
function is the same as the
.Fn hline
function, excepting that the line is drawn in the window specified by
.Fa win .
.Pp
The
.Fn vline
function draws a vertical line of character
.Fa ch
on
.Va stdscr
starting at the current cursor position and moving down until either
.Fa n
characters have been drawn or the bottom of
.Va stdscr
is reached.
If the text portion of
.Fa ch
is 0 then the line will be drawn with the
.Dv ACS_VLINE
character.
.Pp
The
.Fn wvline
function is the same as the
.Fn vline
function, excepting that the line is drawn on the given window.
.Pp
The
.Fn mvhline ,
.Fn mvwhline ,
.Fn mvvline
and
.Fn mvwvline
functions are the same as the
.Fn hline ,
.Fn whline ,
.Fn vline
and
.Fn wvline
functions, respectively, excepting that
.Fn wmove
is called to move the cursor to the position specified by
.Fa y ,
.Fa x
before the line is drawn on the window.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions returning pointers will return
.Dv NULL
if an error is detected.
The functions that return an int will return one of the following
values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ERR -compact
.It Er OK
The function completed successfully.
.It Er ERR
An error occurred in the function.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr curses_border 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nx
Curses library complies with the X/Open Curses specification, part of
the Single Unix Specification.
.Pp
The use of
.Dv ACS_HLINE
and
.Dv ACS_VLINE
as default drawing character in
.Fn hline
and
.Fn vline
is a
.Nx
extension which should not be relied on in portable code.
.Sh HISTORY
The Curses package appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
