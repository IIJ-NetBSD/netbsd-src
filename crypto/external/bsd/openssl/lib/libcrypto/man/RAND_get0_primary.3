.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The default RAND API implementation (\fBRAND_OpenSSL()\fR) utilizes three
shared DRBG instances which are accessed via the RAND API:
.PP
The \fIpublic\fR and \fIprivate\fR DRBG are thread-local instances, which are used
by \fBRAND_bytes()\fR and \fBRAND_priv_bytes()\fR, respectively.
The \fIprimary\fR DRBG is a global instance, which is not intended to be used
directly, but is used internally to reseed the other two instances.
.PP
These functions here provide access to the shared DRBG instances.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBRAND_get0_primary()\fR returns a pointer to the \fIprimary\fR DRBG instance
for the given OSSL_LIB_CTX \fBctx\fR.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_get0_public()\fR returns a pointer to the \fIpublic\fR DRBG instance
for the given OSSL_LIB_CTX \fBctx\fR.
.PP
\&\fBRAND_get0_private()\fR returns a pointer to the \fIprivate\fR DRBG instance
for the given OSSL_LIB_CTX \fBctx\fR.
.PP
In all the above cases the \fBctx\fR parameter can
be NULL in which case the default OSSL_LIB_CTX is used.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
It is not thread-safe to access the \fIprimary\fR DRBG instance.
The \fIpublic\fR and \fIprivate\fR DRBG instance can be accessed safely, because
they are thread-local. Note however, that changes to these two instances
apply only to the current thread.
.PP
For that reason it is recommended not to change the settings of these
three instances directly.
Instead, an application should change the default settings for new DRBG instances
at initialization time, before creating additional threads.
.PP
During initialization, it is possible to change the reseed interval
and reseed time interval.
It is also possible to exchange the reseeding callbacks entirely.
.PP
To set the type of DRBG that will be instantiated, use the
\&\fBRAND_set_DRBG_type\fR\|(3) call before accessing the random number generation
infrastructure.
