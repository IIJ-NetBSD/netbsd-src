.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program reads a
.Em HTTP
request from the standard input, and sends a reply to the standard output.
Besides ~user translation and virtual hosting support (see below), all file
requests are from
.Ar slashdir
directory.
The server uses
.Ar myname
as its name, which defaults to the local hostname, obtained from
.Xr gethostname 3
(but see the
.Fl v
option for virtual hosting.)
.Nm
writes logs to
.Xr syslog 3
using the ftp facility (but see the
.Fl s
option for testing and the
.Fl q
option for suppressing this.)
.Nm
is designed to be small, simple and relatively featureless,
hopefully increasing its security.
.Ss OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width xxxcgibin
.It Fl b
Enables stand-alone daemon mode, where
.Nm
detaches from the current terminal and runs in the background
(unless invoked with
.Fl f ) ,
listens on the appropriate IP address
(see
.Fl i Ar address )
and TCP port
(see
.Fl I Ar port ) ,
and services HTTP requests.
.Nm
does not use
.Xr inetd 8
in stand-alone daemon mode.
.It Fl C Ar suffix cgihandler
Adds a new CGI handler program for a particular file type.
The
.Ar suffix
should be any normal file suffix, and the
.Ar cgihandler
should be a full path to an interpreter.
This option is the only way to enable CGI programs that exist
outside of the cgibin directory to be executed.
Multiple
.Fl C
options may be passed.
.It Fl c Ar cgibin
Enables the CGI/1.1 interface.
The
.Ar cgibin
directory is expected to contain the CGI programs to be used.
.Nm
looks for URLs in the form of
.Ql /cgi-bin/ Ns Ar scriptname
where
.Ar scriptname
is a valid CGI program in the
.Ar cgibin
directory.
In other words, all CGI URLs must begin with
.Ql \%/cgi-bin/ .
Note that the CGI/1.1 interface is available with
.Ql ~user
translation using
.Fl E
switch.
.It Fl d
Enables debug support.
.It Fl E
Enables CGI/1.1 interface for
.Ql ~user
translation.
Note that enabling this support implies that users can run commands
as the web server user.
This may have security implications.
.It Fl e
Do not clear the environment when used with either the
.Fl t
or
.Fl U
options.
.It Fl f
Stops the
.Fl b
option from detaching
.Nm
from the tty and going into the background as part of stand-alone daemon mode.
This implies the
.Fl b
option.
.It Fl G
Get the
.Nm
version string, print it on standard output, and exit.
.It Fl H
Changes directory index mode
(see
.Fl X
option)
to hide files and directories that start with a period
.Pq Ql \&. ,
except for
.Pa .. .
.It Fl I Ar port
Use
.Ar port
instead of the default
.Dq http
port
(usually 80, see
.Xr services 5 ) .
When used with the
.Fl b
or
.Fl f
options, this option changes the bound port.
Otherwise this option forces redirections to use this port
instead of the value obtained via
.Xr getsockname 2 .
.It Fl i Ar address
Use
.Ar address
as the address to bind to in stand-alone daemon mode.
If this option is not provided, all available IP addresses
will be listened to.
Only the last
.Fl i
option is used.
This option is only valid with the
.Fl b
or
.Fl f
options.
.It Fl L Ar prefix script
Adds a new Lua script for a particular prefix.
The
.Ar prefix
should be an arbitrary text, and the
.Ar script
should be a full path to a Lua script.
Multiple
.Fl L
options may be passed.
A separate Lua state is created for each prefix.
The Lua script can register callbacks using the
.Dl httpd.register_handler('suffixpath', luafunc)
Lua function,
which will trigger the execution of the Lua function
.Fn luafunc
when a URL in the form
.Sm off
.Li http:// Ar hostname Li / Ar prefix Li / Ar suffixpath
.Sm on
is being accessed.
The function is passed three tables as arguments, the server
environment, the request headers, and the decoded query string
plus any data that was sent as application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
.It Fl M Ar suffix type encoding encoding11
Adds a new entry to the table that converts file suffixes to
content type and encoding.
This option takes four additional arguments containing
the file prefix, its
.Dq Content-Type ,
.Dq Content-Encoding ,
and
.Dq Content-Encoding
for HTTP/1.1 connections, respectively.
If any of these are a single dash
.Pq Dq - ,
the empty string is used instead.
Multiple
.Fl M
options may be passed.
.It Fl m Ar version
Set the minimum supported SSL protocol
.Ar version .
The valid values of
.Ar version
are
.Dq TLSv1.1 ,
.Dq TLSv1.2 ,
and
.Dq TLSv1.3 .
The default version is
.Dq TLSv1.1 .
.It Fl n
Stops
.Nm
from doing IP address to name resolution of remote hosts.
This affects the
.Ev REMOTE_HOST
environment variable for CGI programs and Lua scripts.
.It Fl P Ar pidfile
Create a PID file in
.Ar pidfile
when run in daemon mode with the
.Fl b
or
.Fl f
options.
.It Fl p Ar pubdir
Changes the default user directory for
.Ql /~user/
translations from
.Pa public_html
to
.Ar pubdir .
.It Fl q
Quiet mode - no log entries generated.
.It Fl R Ar readme
When directory indexing is enabled
(see
.Fl X
option),
include the contents of the file
.Ar readme
in the footer of the directory index.
.It Fl S Ar version
Sets the internal server version to
.Ar version .
.It Fl s
Forces logging to be set to stderr always.
.It Fl T Ar type timeout
Set the timeout for
.Ar type
to
.Ar timeout .
The valid values of
.Ar type
are
.Dq ssl timeout ,
.Dq initial timeout ,
.Dq header timeout ,
and
.Dq request timeout .
The default values are 30 seconds, 30 seconds, 10 seconds and 600 seconds,
respectively.
.It Fl t Ar chrootdir
Makes
.Nm
chroot to the specified directory
before answering requests.
Every other path should be specified relative
to the new root, if this option is used.
Note that the current environment
is normally replaced with an empty environment with this option, unless the
.Fl e
option is also used.
.It Fl U Ar username
Switch to the user and the groups of
.Ar username
after initialization.
This option, like
.Fl t
above, causes
.Nm
to clear the environment unless the
.Fl e
option is given.
.It Fl u
Enables the transformation of Uniform Resource Locators of
the form
.Ql /~user/
into the directory
.Pa ~user/public_html
(but see the
.Fl p
option above).
.It Fl V
Sets the backup virtual host directory to the
.Ar slashdir
argument.
If no directory exists in
.Ar virtualroot
for the request, then
.Ar slashdir
will be used.
The default behavior is to return 404 (Not Found.)
.It Fl v Ar virtualroot
Enables virtual hosting support.
Directories in
.Ar virtualroot
will be searched for a matching virtual host name, when parsing
the HTML request.
If a matching name is found, it will be used
as both the server's real name,
.Op Ar myname ,
and as the
.Ar slashdir .
See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for an example of using this option.
.It Fl X
Enables directory indexing.
A directory index will be generated only when the default
index file is not present
(i.e.,
.Pa index.html
unless changed with
.Fl x Ar index ) .
.It Fl x Ar index
Changes the default file read for directories from
.Pa index.html
to
.Ar index .
.It Fl Z Ar certificate_path privatekey_path
Sets the path to the server certificate file and the private key file
in PEM format.
This option also causes
.Nm
to start SSL mode.
.It Fl z Ar ciphers
Sets the list of SSL ciphers (see
.Xr SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list 3 ) .
.El
.Pp
Note that in
.Nm
versions 20031005 and prior that supported the
.Fl C
and
.Fl M
options, they took a single space-separated argument that was parsed.
since version 20040828, they take multiple options (2 in the case of
.Fl C
and 4 in the case of
.Fl M . )
.Ss INETD CONFIGURATION
By default
.Nm
uses
.Xr inetd 8
by default to process incoming TCP connections for HTTP requests
(unless stand-alone daemon mode is enabled with the
.Fl b
or
.Fl f
options),
.Nm
has little internal networking knowledge.
(Indeed, you can run
.Nm
on the command line with little change of functionality.)
A typical
.Xr inetd.conf 5
entry would be:
.Bd -literal
http stream tcp  nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd /var/www
http stream tcp6 nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd /var/www
.Ed
.Pp
This would serve web pages from
.Pa /var/www
on both IPv4 and IPv6 ports.
The
.Ql :600
changes the
requests per minute to 600, up from the
.Xr inetd 8
default of 40.
.Pp
Using the
.Nx
.Xr inetd 8 ,
you can provide multiple IP-address based HTTP servers by having multiple
listening ports with different configurations.
.Ss NOTES
This server supports the
.Em HTTP/0.9 ,
.Em HTTP/1.0 ,
and
.Em HTTP/1.1
standards.
Support for these protocols is very minimal and many optional features are
not supported.
.Pp
.Nm
can be compiled without
CGI support (NO_CGIBIN_SUPPORT),
user transformations (NO_USER_SUPPORT),
directory index support (NO_DIRINDEX_SUPPORT),
daemon mode support (NO_DAEMON_MODE),
dynamic MIME content (NO_DYNAMIC_CONTENT),
Lua support (NO_LUA_SUPPORT),
and SSL support (NO_SSL_SUPPORT)
by defining the listed macros when building
.Nm .
.Ss HTTP BASIC AUTHORIZATION
.Nm
has support for HTTP Basic Authorization.
If a file named
.Pa .htpasswd
exists in the directory of the current request,
.Nm
will restrict access to documents in that directory
using the RFC 2617 HTTP
.Dq Basic
authentication scheme.
.Pp
Note:
This does not recursively protect any sub-directories.
.Pp
The
.Pa .htpasswd
file contains lines delimited with a colon containing
user names and passwords hashed with
.Xr crypt 3 ,
for example:
.Bd -literal
heather:$1$pZWI4tH/$DzDPl63i6VvVRv2lJNV7k1
jeremy:A.xewbx2DpQ8I
.Ed
.Pp
On
.Nx ,
the
.Xr pwhash 1
utility may be used to generate hashed passwords.
.Pp
While
.Nm
distributed with
.Nx
has support for HTTP Basic Authorization enabled by default,
in the portable distribution this feature is disabled.
Compile
.Nm
with
.Dq -DDO_HTPASSWD
on the compiler command line to enable this support.
This may require linking with the crypt library, using
.Dq -lcrypt .
.Ss BLOCKLIST SUPPORT
On
.Nx ,
.Nm
supports
.Xr blocklistd 8
by default.
The support can be disabled with the
.Dq -DNO_BLOCKLIST_SUPPORT
compilation option.
.Pp
Upon occurrence,
.Nm
reports two HTTP status codes to
.Xr blocklistd 8
as failures:
.Er 401
(``Unauthorized'')
and
.Er 403
(``Forbidden'') .
Of these,
.Er 401
is the one received upon authorization failure with the
HTTP Basic Authorization mechanism.
A successful authorization decreases the counter kept by
.Xr blocklistd 8 .
.Pp
Note that the implementation of the HTTP Basic Authorization mechanism
uses a redirection; a status code
.Er 401
is always initially received.
Therefore, a single authorization failure of
.Pa .htpasswd
is reported as two failures to
.Xr blocklistd 8 ,
but no failures are recorded upon successful authorization
due to the decrease of the failure counter.
.Ss SSL SUPPORT
.Nm
has support for TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols that are included by
default.
This requires linking with the crypto and ssl library, using
.Dq -lcrypto -lssl .
To disable SSL SUPPORT compile
.Nm
with
.Dq -DNO_SSL_SUPPORT
on the compiler command line.
.Pp
To have an enforced redirect, such as http to https, create a shadow
directory root that contains a
.Pa .bzabsredirect
file that points to the real target.
.Ss COMPRESSION
.Nm
supports a very basic form of compression.
.Nm
will serve the requested file postpended with
.Dq Pa .gz
if it exists, it is readable, the client requested gzip compression, and
the client did not make a ranged request.
.Sh FILES
.Nm
processes specific files in each directory that
enables certain features on a per-directory basis.
These per-directory files are:
.Bl -tag -width .htpasswd
.It Pa .bzabsredirect
Symbolic link to the absolute URL pointed to by this symlink.
This is useful to redirect to different servers.
See
.Sx SYMBOLIC LINK REDIRECTION .
.It Pa .bzredirect
Symbolic link to URL for
.Nm
to perform a smart redirect to the target of this symlink.
The target is assumed to live on the same server.
If target starts with slash then absolute redirection is performed,
otherwise it is handled as relative.
See
.Sx SYMBOLIC LINK REDIRECTION .
.It Pa .bzremap
Used by rewrite mappings; see
.Sx REWRITE MAPPINGS .
.It Pa .htpasswd
Used by HTTP basic authorization; see
.Sx HTTP BASIC AUTHORIZATION .
.El
.Ss SYMBOLIC LINK REDIRECTION
Two forms of redirection are supported:
.Bl -enum
.It
A symbolic link without schema will use
.Li http://
as default.
E.g., a symbolic link to
.Pa NetBSD.org
will redirect to
.Lk http://NetBSD.org/ .
.It
A symbolic link with a schema uses the provided schema.
E.g., a symbolic link to
.Pa ftp://NetBSD.org/
will redirect to
.Lk ftp://NetBSD.org/ .
.El
.Ss REWRITE MAPPINGS
If a
.Pa .bzremap
file is found at the root of a (virtual) server, it is expected to contain
rewrite mappings for URLs.
.Pp
These remappings are performed internally in the server before authentication
happens and can be used to hide implementation details, like the CGI handler
specific suffix for non cgi scripts in authorized directories.
.Pp
The map file consists of lines two paths separated by a colon, where the left
side needs to exactly match a (sub) path of the request and will be replaced
by the right side.
.Pp
The first match always wins.
.Pp
A
.Pa .bzremap
file could look like this:
.Bd -literal
/nic/update:/auth-dir/updipv4.pl
.Ed
.Pp
The remap file should be short, access to it is slow and needs to happen
on each request.
If a request path needs to include a colon
.Pq Ql \&:
character, it can be escaped
with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e
The right hand side of the colon is always used verbatim, no escape sequences
are interpreted.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To configure set of virtual hosts, one would use an
.Xr inetd.conf 5
entry like:
.Bd -literal
http stream tcp  nowait:600 _httpd /usr/libexec/httpd httpd -v /var/vroot /var/www
.Ed
.Pp
and inside
.Pa /var/vroot
create a directory (or a symlink to a directory) with the same name as
the virtual host, for each virtual host.
Lookups for these names are done in a case-insensitive manner, and may
include the port number part of the request, allowing for distinct
virtual hosts on the same name.
.Pp
To use
.Nm
with PHP, one must use the
.Fl C
option to specify a CGI handler for a particular file type.
Typically this will be like:
.Bd -literal
httpd -C .php /usr/pkg/bin/php-cgi /var/www
.Ed
.Pp
Note that a plain script interpreter can not be used directly as a cgihandler,
as there are no command line options passed from
.Nm
to avoid security issues.
.Pp
If no CGI-aware wrapper exists, a simple shell script like the following
might do.
.Pp
It would be invoked like:
.Bd -literal
httpd -C .pl /www-scripts/bin/run.perl /var/www
.Ed
and the script could look like:
.Bd -literal
#! /bin/sh

if [ -r "$SCRIPT_FILENAME" -a -x "$SCRIPT_FILENAME" ]; then
	exec /usr/pkg/bin/perl "$SCRIPT_FILENAME"
fi

exit 1

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was first written in perl, based on another perl http server
called
.Dq tinyhttpd .
It was then rewritten from scratch in perl, and then once again in C.
From
.Dq bozohttpd
version 20060517, it has been integrated into
.Nx .
The focus has always been simplicity and security, with minimal features
and regular code audits.
This manual documents
.Nm
version 20240428.
