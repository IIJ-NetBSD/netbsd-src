/*
 * These assume Total Store Order (TSO), which may reorder
 * store-before-load but nothing else.  Hence, only membar_sync (and
 * its deprecated alias membar_enter) must issue anything --
 * specifically, an LDSTUB, which (along with SWAP) is the only
 * instruction that implies a sequential consistency barrier.  (SWAP is
 * not available in sparcv7, and maybe not all sparcv8, so we use
 * LDSTUB here.)
 *
 * If we ran with Partial Store Order (PSO), we would also need to
 * issue STBAR for membar_release (load/store-before-store) and
 * membar_producer (store-before-store).
 *
 * Sync membar_sync with paravirt_membar_sync in
 * sys/arch/sparc/sparc/locore.s.
