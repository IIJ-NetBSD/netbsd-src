# less2netbsd: Prepare a less source tree for import into the NetBSD
# source repository, under src/external .
# based on many other *2netbsd scripts
#
# Rough instructions for importing new less release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/less/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/less/less2netbsd less-xyz `pwd`
#	$ cd src/external/bsd/less/dist
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import src/external/bsd/less/dist \
#		GREENWOODSOFTWARE LESS-xyz
#	   Enter the new NEWS portion as your commit message
#	   Check for any conflicts, merge, fix and commit them
#	$ cd ../../../../../less-xyz
#	$ ./configure
#	   Add "/*	$NetBSD: less2netbsd,v 1.8 2025/10/08 06:00:35 simonb Exp $	*/" to new defines.h
#	$ cp defines.h /usr/src/external/bsd/less/include
#	$ cd /usr/src/external/bsd/less
#	$ cvs update
#	$ cvs commit -m "Updated autoconf generated files for less xyz."
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	   ... and clean up the leftovers
