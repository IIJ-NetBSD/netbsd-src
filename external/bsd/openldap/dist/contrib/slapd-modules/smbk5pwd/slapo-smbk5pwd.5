.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B smbk5pwd
overlay to
.BR slapd (8)
overloads the Password Modify Extended Operation (RFC 3062) to update
Kerberos keys and Samba password hashes for an LDAP user, as well as
updating password change related attributes for Kerberos, Samba and/or
UNIX user accounts.
.LP
The Samba support is written using the Samba 3.0 LDAP schema;
Kerberos support is written for Heimdal using its hdb-ldap backend.
.LP
Additionally, a new
.B {K5KEY}
password hash mechanism is provided.
For
.B krb5KDCEntry
objects that have this scheme specifier in their
.I userPassword
attribute, Simple Binds will be checked against the Kerberos keys of the entry.
No data is needed after the
.B {K5KEY}
scheme specifier in the
.IR userPassword ,
it is looked up from the entry directly.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The
.B smbk5pwd
overlay supports the following
.B slapd.conf
configuration options, which should appear after the
.B overlay
directive:
.TP
.BI smbk5pwd-enable " <module>"
can be used to enable only the desired modules.
Legal values for
.I <module>
are
.LP
.RS
.TP
.B krb5
If the user has the
.B krb5KDCEntry
objectclass, update the
.B krb5Key
and
.B krb5KeyVersionNumber
attributes using the new password in the Password Modify operation,
provided the Kerberos account is not expired.
Exiration is determined by evaluating the
.B krb5ValidEnd
attribute.
.TP
.B samba
If the user is a
.B sambaSamAccount
object, synchronize the
.B sambaNTPassword
to the password entered in the Password Modify operation, and update
.B sambaPwdLastSet
accordingly.
.TP
.B shadow
Update the attribute
.BR shadowLastChange ,
if the entry has the objectclass
.BR shadowAccount .
.LP
By default all modules compiled in are enabled.
Setting the config statement restricts the enabled modules to the ones
explicitly mentioned.
.RE
.TP
.BI smbk5pwd-can-change " <seconds>"
If the
.B samba
module is enabled and the user is a
.BR sambaSamAccount ,
update the attribute
.B sambaPwdCanChange
to point
.I <seconds>
into the future, essentially denying any Samba password change until then.
A value of
.B 0
disables this feature.
.TP
.BI smbk5pwd-must-change " <seconds>"
If the
.B samba
module is enabled and the user is a
.BR sambaSamAccount ,
update the attribute
.B sambaPwdMustChange
to point
.I <seconds>
into the future, essentially setting the Samba password expiration time.
A value of
.B 0
disables this feature.
.LP
Alternatively, the overlay supports table-driven configuration,
and thus can be run-time loaded and configured via back-config.

.SH EXAMPLE
The layout of a slapd.d based, table-driven configuration entry looks like:
.LP
.EX
        # {0}smbk5pwd, {1}mdb, config
        dn: olcOverlay={0}smbk5pwd,olcDatabase={1}mdb,cn=config
        objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
        objectClass: olcSmbK5PwdConfig
        olcOverlay: {0}smbk5pwd
        olcSmbK5PwdEnable: krb5
        olcSmbK5PwdEnable: samba
        olcSmbK5PwdMustChange: 2592000
.EE
.LP
which enables both
.B krb5
and
.B samba
modules with a Samba password expiration time of 30 days (=
.B 2592000
seconds).
