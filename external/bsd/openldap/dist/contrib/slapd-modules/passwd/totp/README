TOTP OpenLDAP support
----------------------

slapd-totp.c provides support for RFC 6238 TOTP Time-based One
Time Passwords in OpenLDAP using SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
For instance, one could have the LDAP attribute:

userPassword: {TOTP1}GEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQGEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQ

which encodes the key '12345678901234567890'.

It can also encode credentials consisting of a TOTP and a static
password.  The format for this is:

userPassword: {TOTP1ANDPW}GEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQGEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQ|<some_other_passwd>

where <some_other_passwd> can be any scheme currently understood
by OpenLDAP.  For example, using '{SHA}5en6G6MezRroT3XKqkdPOmY/BfQ='
would encode the above TOTP with a static password of 'secret'.  To
authenticate using this scheme, enter the static password immediately
followed by the TOTP, for example 'secret123456'.


Building
--------

1) Customize the LDAP_SRC variable in Makefile to point to the OpenLDAP
source root.

2) Run 'make' to produce pw-totp.so

3) Copy pw-totp.so somewhere permanent.

4) Edit your slapd.conf (eg. /etc/ldap/slapd.conf), and add:

moduleload ...path/to/pw-totp.so

5) This module replaces the function of the slapo-lastbind overlay. You
cannot use that overlay on the same database as this one.

6) Restart slapd.


Configuring
-----------

The {TOTP1}, {TOTP256}, {TOTP512}, {TOTP1ANDPW}, {TOTP256ANDPW},
and {TOTP512ANDPW} password schemes should now be recognised.

You can also tell OpenLDAP to use one of these new schemes when processing LDAP
Password Modify Extended Operations, thanks to the password-hash option in
slapd.conf. For example:

password-hash	{TOTP1}

TOTP password schemes will only work on databases that have a rootdn and the
totp overlay configured:

database mdb
rootdn "..."
...

overlay totp



Testing
-------

The TOTP1 algorithm is compatible with Google Authenticator.
