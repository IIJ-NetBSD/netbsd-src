Running slapd under GDB in our testsuite, KILLPIDS would record gdb's PID
rather than slapd's. When we want the server to shut down, SIGHUP is sent to
KILLPIDS but GDB cannot handle being signalled directly and the entire thing is
terminated immediately. There might be tests that rely on slapd being given the
chance to shut down gracefully, to do this, we need to make sure the signal is
actually sent to slapd.

This script attempts to address this shortcoming in our test suite, serving as
the front for gdb/other wrappers, catching SIGHUPs and redirecting them to the
oldest living grandchild. The way we start up gdb, that process should be
slapd, our intended target.

This requires the pgrep utility provided by the procps package on Debian
systems.
