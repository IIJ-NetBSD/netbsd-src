/** @file epoch.c
 *
 * Implementation of epoch based memory reclamation, in principle
 * similar to the algorithm presented in
 * https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-579.pdf
 *
 * Not completely lock-free at the moment.
 *
 * Also the problems with epoch based memory reclamation are still
 * present - a thread actively observing an epoch getting stuck will
 * prevent managed objects (in our case connections and operations)
 * from being freed, potentially running out of memory.
