# cron2netbsd:  convert a cron source tree into a
# netbsd cron source tree, under src/external/bsd/cron,
# based on bind2netbsd by Bernd Ernesti and changes by Simon Burge
#
# Rough instructions for importing new cron release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/cron/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/external/bsd/cron/dist/cron2netbsd crondir `pwd`
#	$ cd src/external/bsd/cron/dist
#	$ cvs -d cvs.netbsd.org:/cvsroot import -m "Import cron 4.1" src/external/bsd/cron/dist ISC cron-4_1
#
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
