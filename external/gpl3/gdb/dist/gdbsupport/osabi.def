/* Each definition in this file is an osabi known to GDB.

   The first argument is used to create the enum name and is appended
   to 'GDB_OSABI_'.

   The second argument is the osabi name.  These strings can't be
   changed _ever_ as gdbserver will emit these.  Changing these
   strings would break compatibility with already released versions of
   GDB and/or gdbserver.

   The third argument is a regexp which matches against a target
   triplet.  */
