1 About This Guide
******************

This guide describes the use of GNAT, a compiler and software
development toolset for the full Ada programming language.  It documents
the features of the compiler and tools, and explains how to use them to
build Ada applications.

GNAT implements Ada 95, Ada 2005, Ada 2012, and Ada 202x, and it may
also be invoked in Ada 83 compatibility mode.  By default, GNAT assumes
Ada 2012, but you can override with a compiler switch (*note Compiling
Different Versions of Ada: 6.) to explicitly specify the language
version.  Throughout this manual, references to ‘Ada’ without a year
suffix apply to all Ada versions of the language, starting with Ada 95.

2 Getting Started with GNAT
***************************

This chapter describes how to use GNAT’s command line interface to build
executable Ada programs.  On most platforms a visually oriented
Integrated Development Environment is also available: GNAT Studio.  GNAT
Studio offers a graphical “look and feel”, support for development in
other programming languages, comprehensive browsing features, and many
other capabilities.  For information on GNAT Studio please refer to the
‘GNAT Studio documentation’.

* Running a Program with Multiple Units::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: System Requirements,  Next: Running GNAT,  Up: Getting Started with GNAT

2.1 System Requirements
=======================

Even though any machine can run the GNAT toolset and GNAT Studio IDE, in
order to get the best experience, we recommend using a machine with as
many cores as possible since all individual compilations can run in
parallel.  A comfortable setup for a compiler server is a machine with
24 physical cores or more, with at least 48 GB of memory (2 GB per
core).

For a desktop machine, a minimum of 4 cores is recommended (8
preferred), with at least 2GB per core (so 8 to 16GB).

In addition, for running and navigating sources in GNAT Studio smoothly,
we recommend at least 1.5 GB plus 3 GB of RAM per 1 million source line
of code.  In other words, we recommend at least 3 GB for for 500K lines
of code and 7.5 GB for 2 million lines of code.

Note that using local and fast drives will also make a difference in
terms of build and link time.  Network drives such as NFS, SMB, or
worse, configuration management filesystems (such as ClearCase dynamic
views) should be avoided as much as possible and will produce very
degraded performance (typically 2 to 3 times slower than on local fast
drives).  If such slow drives cannot be avoided for accessing the source
code, then you should at least configure your project file so that the
result of the compilation is stored on a drive local to the machine
performing the run.  This can be achieved by setting the ‘Object_Dir’
project file attribute.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Running GNAT,  Next: Running a Simple Ada Program,  Prev: System Requirements,  Up: Getting Started with GNAT

2.2 Running GNAT
================

Three steps are needed to create an executable file from an Ada source
file:

   * The source file(s) must be compiled.

   * The file(s) must be bound using the GNAT binder.

   * All appropriate object files must be linked to produce an
     executable.

All three steps are most commonly handled by using the ‘gnatmake’
utility program that, given the name of the main program, automatically
performs the necessary compilation, binding and linking steps.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Running a Simple Ada Program,  Next: Running a Program with Multiple Units,  Prev: Running GNAT,  Up: Getting Started with GNAT

2.3 Running a Simple Ada Program
================================

Any text editor may be used to prepare an Ada program.  (If Emacs is
used, the optional Ada mode may be helpful in laying out the program.)
The program text is a normal text file.  We will assume in our initial
example that you have used your editor to prepare the following standard
format text file:

     with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
     procedure Hello is
     begin
        Put_Line ("Hello WORLD!");
     end Hello;

This file should be named ‘hello.adb’.  With the normal default file
naming conventions, GNAT requires that each file contain a single
compilation unit whose file name is the unit name, with periods replaced
by hyphens; the extension is ‘ads’ for a spec and ‘adb’ for a body.  You
can override this default file naming convention by use of the special
pragma ‘Source_File_Name’ (for further information please see *note
Using Other File Names: 1c.).  Alternatively, if you want to rename your
files according to this default convention, which is probably more
convenient if you will be using GNAT for all your compilations, then the
‘gnatchop’ utility can be used to generate correctly-named source files
(see *note Renaming Files with gnatchop: 1d.).

You can compile the program using the following command (‘$’ is used as
the command prompt in the examples in this document):

     $ gcc -c hello.adb

‘gcc’ is the command used to run the compiler.  This compiler is capable
of compiling programs in several languages, including Ada and C. It
assumes that you have given it an Ada program if the file extension is
either ‘.ads’ or ‘.adb’, and it will then call the GNAT compiler to
compile the specified file.

The ‘-c’ switch is required.  It tells ‘gcc’ to only do a compilation.
(For C programs, ‘gcc’ can also do linking, but this capability is not
used directly for Ada programs, so the ‘-c’ switch must always be
present.)

This compile command generates a file ‘hello.o’, which is the object
file corresponding to your Ada program.  It also generates an ‘Ada
Library Information’ file ‘hello.ali’, which contains additional
information used to check that an Ada program is consistent.

To build an executable file, use either ‘gnatmake’ or gprbuild with the
name of the main file: these tools are builders that will take care of
all the necessary build steps in the correct order.  In particular,
these builders automatically recompile any sources that have been
modified since they were last compiled, or sources that depend on such
modified sources, so that ‘version skew’ is avoided.

     $ gnatmake hello.adb

The result is an executable program called ‘hello’, which can be run by
entering:

     $ hello

assuming that the current directory is on the search path for executable
programs.

and, if all has gone well, you will see:

     Hello WORLD!

appear in response to this command.

2.4 Running a Program with Multiple Units
=========================================

Consider a slightly more complicated example that has three files: a
main program, and the spec and body of a package:

     package Greetings is
        procedure Hello;
        procedure Goodbye;
     end Greetings;

     with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
     package body Greetings is
        procedure Hello is
        begin
           Put_Line ("Hello WORLD!");
        end Hello;

        procedure Goodbye is
        begin
           Put_Line ("Goodbye WORLD!");
        end Goodbye;
     end Greetings;

     with Greetings;
     procedure Gmain is
     begin
        Greetings.Hello;
        Greetings.Goodbye;
     end Gmain;

Following the one-unit-per-file rule, place this program in the
following three separate files:

‘greetings.ads’

     spec of package ‘Greetings’

‘greetings.adb’

     body of package ‘Greetings’

‘gmain.adb’

     body of main program

Note that there is no required order of compilation when using GNAT. In
particular it is perfectly fine to compile the main program first.
Also, it is not necessary to compile package specs in the case where
there is an accompanying body; you only need to compile the body.  If
you want to submit these files to the compiler for semantic checking and
not code generation, then use the ‘-gnatc’ switch:

     $ gcc -c greetings.ads -gnatc

Although the compilation can be done in separate steps, in practice it
is almost always more convenient to use the ‘gnatmake’ or ‘gprbuild’
tools:

     $ gnatmake gmain.adb

3 The GNAT Compilation Model
****************************

This chapter describes the compilation model used by GNAT. Although
similar to that used by other languages such as C and C++, this model is
substantially different from the traditional Ada compilation models,
which are based on a centralized program library.  The chapter covers
the following material:

3.1 Source Representation
=========================

Ada source programs are represented in standard text files, using
Latin-1 coding.  Latin-1 is an 8-bit code that includes the familiar
7-bit ASCII set, plus additional characters used for representing
foreign languages (see *note Foreign Language Representation: 23. for
support of non-USA character sets).  The format effector characters are
represented using their standard ASCII encodings, as follows:

     Character       Effect                      Code
                                                 
                                                 
     ‘VT’            Vertical tab                ‘16#0B#’
                                                 
                                                 
     ‘HT’            Horizontal tab              ‘16#09#’
                                                 
                                                 
     ‘CR’            Carriage return             ‘16#0D#’
                                                 
                                                 
     ‘LF’            Line feed                   ‘16#0A#’
                                                 
                                                 
     ‘FF’            Form feed                   ‘16#0C#’
                                                 

Source files are in standard text file format.  In addition, GNAT will
recognize a wide variety of stream formats, in which the end of physical
lines is marked by any of the following sequences: ‘LF’, ‘CR’, ‘CR-LF’,
or ‘LF-CR’.  This is useful in accommodating files that are imported
from other operating systems.

The end of a source file is normally represented by the physical end of
file.  However, the control character ‘16#1A#’ (‘SUB’) is also
recognized as signalling the end of the source file.  Again, this is
provided for compatibility with other operating systems where this code
is used to represent the end of file.

Each file contains a single Ada compilation unit, including any pragmas
associated with the unit.  For example, this means you must place a
package declaration (a package ‘spec’) and the corresponding body in
separate files.  An Ada ‘compilation’ (which is a sequence of
compilation units) is represented using a sequence of files.  Similarly,
you will place each subunit or child unit in a separate file.

3.2 Foreign Language Representation
===================================

GNAT supports the standard character sets defined in Ada as well as
several other non-standard character sets for use in localized versions
of the compiler (*note Character Set Control: 31.).

* Menu:

* Latin-1::
* Other 8-Bit Codes::
* Wide_Character Encodings::
* Wide_Wide_Character Encodings::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Latin-1,  Next: Other 8-Bit Codes,  Up: Foreign Language Representation

3.2.1 Latin-1
-------------

The basic character set is Latin-1.  This character set is defined by
ISO standard 8859, part 1.  The lower half (character codes ‘16#00#’ …
‘16#7F#)’ is identical to standard ASCII coding, but the upper half is
used to represent additional characters.  These include extended letters
used by European languages, such as French accents, the vowels with
umlauts used in German, and the extra letter A-ring used in Swedish.

For a complete list of Latin-1 codes and their encodings, see the source
file of library unit ‘Ada.Characters.Latin_1’ in file ‘a-chlat1.ads’.
You may use any of these extended characters freely in character or
string literals.  In addition, the extended characters that represent
letters can be used in identifiers.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Other 8-Bit Codes,  Next: Wide_Character Encodings,  Prev: Latin-1,  Up: Foreign Language Representation

3.2.2 Other 8-Bit Codes
-----------------------

GNAT also supports several other 8-bit coding schemes:

‘ISO 8859-2 (Latin-2)’

     Latin-2 letters allowed in identifiers, with uppercase and
     lowercase equivalence.

‘ISO 8859-3 (Latin-3)’

     Latin-3 letters allowed in identifiers, with uppercase and
     lowercase equivalence.

‘ISO 8859-4 (Latin-4)’

     Latin-4 letters allowed in identifiers, with uppercase and
     lowercase equivalence.

‘ISO 8859-5 (Cyrillic)’

     ISO 8859-5 letters (Cyrillic) allowed in identifiers, with
     uppercase and lowercase equivalence.

‘ISO 8859-15 (Latin-9)’

     ISO 8859-15 (Latin-9) letters allowed in identifiers, with
     uppercase and lowercase equivalence.

‘IBM PC (code page 437)’

     This code page is the normal default for PCs in the U.S. It
     corresponds to the original IBM PC character set.  This set has
     some, but not all, of the extended Latin-1 letters, but these
     letters do not have the same encoding as Latin-1.  In this mode,
     these letters are allowed in identifiers with uppercase and
     lowercase equivalence.

‘IBM PC (code page 850)’

     This code page is a modification of 437 extended to include all the
     Latin-1 letters, but still not with the usual Latin-1 encoding.  In
     this mode, all these letters are allowed in identifiers with
     uppercase and lowercase equivalence.

‘Full Upper 8-bit’

     Any character in the range 80-FF allowed in identifiers, and all
     are considered distinct.  In other words, there are no uppercase
     and lowercase equivalences in this range.  This is useful in
     conjunction with certain encoding schemes used for some foreign
     character sets (e.g., the typical method of representing Chinese
     characters on the PC).

‘No Upper-Half’

     No upper-half characters in the range 80-FF are allowed in
     identifiers.  This gives Ada 83 compatibility for identifier names.

For precise data on the encodings permitted, and the uppercase and
lowercase equivalences that are recognized, see the file ‘csets.adb’ in
the GNAT compiler sources.  You will need to obtain a full source
release of GNAT to obtain this file.

3.2.3 Wide_Character Encodings
------------------------------

GNAT allows wide character codes to appear in character and string
literals, and also optionally in identifiers, by means of the following
possible encoding schemes:

‘Hex Coding’

     In this encoding, a wide character is represented by the following
     five character sequence:

          ESC a b c d

     where ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ are the four hexadecimal characters (using
     uppercase letters) of the wide character code.  For example, ESC
     A345 is used to represent the wide character with code ‘16#A345#’.
     This scheme is compatible with use of the full Wide_Character set.

‘Upper-Half Coding’

     The wide character with encoding ‘16#abcd#’ where the upper bit is
     on (in other words, ‘a’ is in the range 8-F) is represented as two
     bytes, ‘16#ab#’ and ‘16#cd#’.  The second byte cannot be a format
     control character, but is not required to be in the upper half.
     This method can be also used for shift-JIS or EUC, where the
     internal coding matches the external coding.

‘Shift JIS Coding’

     A wide character is represented by a two-character sequence,
     ‘16#ab#’ and ‘16#cd#’, with the restrictions described for
     upper-half encoding as described above.  The internal character
     code is the corresponding JIS character according to the standard
     algorithm for Shift-JIS conversion.  Only characters defined in the
     JIS code set table can be used with this encoding method.

‘EUC Coding’

     A wide character is represented by a two-character sequence
     ‘16#ab#’ and ‘16#cd#’, with both characters being in the upper
     half.  The internal character code is the corresponding JIS
     character according to the EUC encoding algorithm.  Only characters
     defined in the JIS code set table can be used with this encoding
     method.

‘UTF-8 Coding’

     A wide character is represented using UCS Transformation Format 8
     (UTF-8) as defined in Annex R of ISO 10646-1/Am.2.  Depending on
     the character value, the representation is a one, two, or three
     byte sequence:

          16#0000#-16#007f#: 2#0xxxxxxx#
          16#0080#-16#07ff#: 2#110xxxxx# 2#10xxxxxx#
          16#0800#-16#ffff#: 2#1110xxxx# 2#10xxxxxx# 2#10xxxxxx#

     where the ‘xxx’ bits correspond to the left-padded bits of the
     16-bit character value.  Note that all lower half ASCII characters
     are represented as ASCII bytes and all upper half characters and
     other wide characters are represented as sequences of upper-half
     (The full UTF-8 scheme allows for encoding 31-bit characters as
     6-byte sequences, and in the following section on wide wide
     characters, the use of these sequences is documented).

‘Brackets Coding’

     In this encoding, a wide character is represented by the following
     eight character sequence:

          [ " a b c d " ]

     where ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ are the four hexadecimal characters (using
     uppercase letters) of the wide character code.  For example,
     [‘A345’] is used to represent the wide character with code
     ‘16#A345#’.  It is also possible (though not required) to use the
     Brackets coding for upper half characters.  For example, the code
     ‘16#A3#’ can be represented as ‘['A3']’.

     This scheme is compatible with use of the full Wide_Character set,
     and is also the method used for wide character encoding in some
     standard ACATS (Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite) test suite
     distributions.

     Note: Some of these coding schemes do not permit the full use of
     the Ada character set.  For example, neither Shift JIS nor EUC
     allow the use of the upper half of the Latin-1 set.

3.2.4 Wide_Wide_Character Encodings
-----------------------------------

GNAT allows wide wide character codes to appear in character and string
literals, and also optionally in identifiers, by means of the following
possible encoding schemes:

‘UTF-8 Coding’

     A wide character is represented using UCS Transformation Format 8
     (UTF-8) as defined in Annex R of ISO 10646-1/Am.2.  Depending on
     the character value, the representation of character codes with
     values greater than 16#FFFF# is a is a four, five, or six byte
     sequence:

          16#01_0000#-16#10_FFFF#:     11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                       10xxxxxx
          16#0020_0000#-16#03FF_FFFF#: 111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                       10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
          16#0400_0000#-16#7FFF_FFFF#: 1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                       10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

     where the ‘xxx’ bits correspond to the left-padded bits of the
     32-bit character value.

‘Brackets Coding’

     In this encoding, a wide wide character is represented by the
     following ten or twelve byte character sequence:

          [ " a b c d e f " ]
          [ " a b c d e f g h " ]

     where ‘a-h’ are the six or eight hexadecimal characters (using
     uppercase letters) of the wide wide character code.  For example,
     [“1F4567”] is used to represent the wide wide character with code
     ‘16#001F_4567#’.

     This scheme is compatible with use of the full Wide_Wide_Character
     set, and is also the method used for wide wide character encoding
     in some standard ACATS (Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite) test
     suite distributions.

3.3 File Naming Topics and Utilities
====================================

GNAT has a default file naming scheme and also provides the user with a
high degree of control over how the names and extensions of the source
files correspond to the Ada compilation units that they contain.

* Using Other File Names::

* Renaming Files with gnatchop::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: File Naming Rules,  Next: Using Other File Names,  Up: File Naming Topics and Utilities

3.3.1 File Naming Rules
-----------------------

The default file name is determined by the name of the unit that the
file contains.  The name is formed by taking the full expanded name of
the unit and replacing the separating dots with hyphens and using
lowercase for all letters.

An exception arises if the file name generated by the above rules starts
with one of the characters ‘a’, ‘g’, ‘i’, or ‘s’, and the second
character is a minus.  In this case, the character tilde is used in
place of the minus.  The reason for this special rule is to avoid
clashes with the standard names for child units of the packages System,
Ada, Interfaces, and GNAT, which use the prefixes ‘s-’, ‘a-’, ‘i-’, and
‘g-’, respectively.

The file extension is ‘.ads’ for a spec and ‘.adb’ for a body.  The
following table shows some examples of these rules.

     Source File                      Ada Compilation Unit
                                      
                                      
     ‘main.ads’                       Main (spec)
                                      
                                      
     ‘main.adb’                       Main (body)
                                      
                                      
     ‘arith_functions.ads’            Arith_Functions (package spec)
                                      
                                      
     ‘arith_functions.adb’            Arith_Functions (package body)
                                      
                                      
     ‘func-spec.ads’                  Func.Spec (child package spec)
                                      
                                      
     ‘func-spec.adb’                  Func.Spec (child package body)
                                      
                                      
     ‘main-sub.adb’                   Sub (subunit of Main)
                                      
                                      
     ‘a~bad.adb’                      A.Bad (child package body)
                                      

Following these rules can result in excessively long file names if
corresponding unit names are long (for example, if child units or
subunits are heavily nested).  An option is available to shorten such
long file names (called file name ‘krunching’).  This may be
particularly useful when programs being developed with GNAT are to be
used on operating systems with limited file name lengths.  *note Using
gnatkr: 3d.

Of course, no file shortening algorithm can guarantee uniqueness over
all possible unit names; if file name krunching is used, it is your
responsibility to ensure no name clashes occur.  Alternatively you can
specify the exact file names that you want used, as described in the
next section.  Finally, if your Ada programs are migrating from a
compiler with a different naming convention, you can use the gnatchop
utility to produce source files that follow the GNAT naming conventions.
(For details see *note Renaming Files with gnatchop: 1d.)

Note: in the case of Windows or Mac OS operating systems, case is not
significant.  So for example on Windows if the canonical name is
‘main-sub.adb’, you can use the file name ‘Main-Sub.adb’ instead.
However, case is significant for other operating systems, so for
example, if you want to use other than canonically cased file names on a
Unix system, you need to follow the procedures described in the next
section.

3.3.2 Using Other File Names
----------------------------

In the previous section, we have described the default rules used by
GNAT to determine the file name in which a given unit resides.  It is
often convenient to follow these default rules, and if you follow them,
the compiler knows without being explicitly told where to find all the
files it needs.

However, in some cases, particularly when a program is imported from
another Ada compiler environment, it may be more convenient for the
programmer to specify which file names contain which units.  GNAT allows
arbitrary file names to be used by means of the Source_File_Name pragma.
The form of this pragma is as shown in the following examples:

     pragma Source_File_Name (My_Utilities.Stacks,
       Spec_File_Name => "myutilst_a.ada");
     pragma Source_File_name (My_Utilities.Stacks,
       Body_File_Name => "myutilst.ada");

As shown in this example, the first argument for the pragma is the unit
name (in this example a child unit).  The second argument has the form
of a named association.  The identifier indicates whether the file name
is for a spec or a body; the file name itself is given by a string
literal.

The source file name pragma is a configuration pragma, which means that
normally it will be placed in the ‘gnat.adc’ file used to hold
configuration pragmas that apply to a complete compilation environment.
For more details on how the ‘gnat.adc’ file is created and used see
*note Handling of Configuration Pragmas: 3f.

GNAT allows completely arbitrary file names to be specified using the
source file name pragma.  However, if the file name specified has an
extension other than ‘.ads’ or ‘.adb’ it is necessary to use a special
syntax when compiling the file.  The name in this case must be preceded
by the special sequence ‘-x’ followed by a space and the name of the
language, here ‘ada’, as in:

     $ gcc -c -x ada peculiar_file_name.sim

‘gnatmake’ handles non-standard file names in the usual manner (the
non-standard file name for the main program is simply used as the
argument to gnatmake).  Note that if the extension is also non-standard,
then it must be included in the ‘gnatmake’ command, it may not be
omitted.

3.3.3 Alternative File Naming Schemes
-------------------------------------

The previous section described the use of the ‘Source_File_Name’ pragma
to allow arbitrary names to be assigned to individual source files.
However, this approach requires one pragma for each file, and especially
in large systems can result in very long ‘gnat.adc’ files, and also
create a maintenance problem.

GNAT also provides a facility for specifying systematic file naming
schemes other than the standard default naming scheme previously
described.  An alternative scheme for naming is specified by the use of
‘Source_File_Name’ pragmas having the following format:

     pragma Source_File_Name (
        Spec_File_Name  => FILE_NAME_PATTERN
      [ , Casing          => CASING_SPEC]
      [ , Dot_Replacement => STRING_LITERAL ] );

     pragma Source_File_Name (
        Body_File_Name  => FILE_NAME_PATTERN
      [ , Casing          => CASING_SPEC ]
      [ , Dot_Replacement => STRING_LITERAL ] ) ;

     pragma Source_File_Name (
        Subunit_File_Name  => FILE_NAME_PATTERN
      [ , Casing          => CASING_SPEC ]
      [ , Dot_Replacement => STRING_LITERAL ] ) ;

     FILE_NAME_PATTERN ::= STRING_LITERAL
     CASING_SPEC ::= Lowercase | Uppercase | Mixedcase

The ‘FILE_NAME_PATTERN’ string shows how the file name is constructed.
It contains a single asterisk character, and the unit name is
substituted systematically for this asterisk.  The optional parameter
‘Casing’ indicates whether the unit name is to be all upper-case
letters, all lower-case letters, or mixed-case.  If no ‘Casing’
parameter is used, then the default is all lower-case.

The optional ‘Dot_Replacement’ string is used to replace any periods
that occur in subunit or child unit names.  If no ‘Dot_Replacement’
argument is used then separating dots appear unchanged in the resulting
file name.  Although the above syntax indicates that the ‘Casing’
argument must appear before the ‘Dot_Replacement’ argument, but it is
also permissible to write these arguments in the opposite order.

As indicated, it is possible to specify different naming schemes for
bodies, specs, and subunits.  Quite often the rule for subunits is the
same as the rule for bodies, in which case, there is no need to give a
separate ‘Subunit_File_Name’ rule, and in this case the ‘Body_File_name’
rule is used for subunits as well.

The separate rule for subunits can also be used to implement the rather
unusual case of a compilation environment (e.g., a single directory)
which contains a subunit and a child unit with the same unit name.
Although both units cannot appear in the same partition, the Ada
Reference Manual allows (but does not require) the possibility of the
two units coexisting in the same environment.

The file name translation works in the following steps:

   * If there is a specific ‘Source_File_Name’ pragma for the given
     unit, then this is always used, and any general pattern rules are
     ignored.

   * If there is a pattern type ‘Source_File_Name’ pragma that applies
     to the unit, then the resulting file name will be used if the file
     exists.  If more than one pattern matches, the latest one will be
     tried first, and the first attempt resulting in a reference to a
     file that exists will be used.

   * If no pattern type ‘Source_File_Name’ pragma that applies to the
     unit for which the corresponding file exists, then the standard
     GNAT default naming rules are used.

As an example of the use of this mechanism, consider a commonly used
scheme in which file names are all lower case, with separating periods
copied unchanged to the resulting file name, and specs end with
‘.1.ada’, and bodies end with ‘.2.ada’.  GNAT will follow this scheme if
the following two pragmas appear:

     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Spec_File_Name => ".1.ada");
     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Body_File_Name => ".2.ada");

The default GNAT scheme is actually implemented by providing the
following default pragmas internally:

     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Spec_File_Name => ".ads", Dot_Replacement => "-");
     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Body_File_Name => ".adb", Dot_Replacement => "-");

Our final example implements a scheme typically used with one of the Ada
83 compilers, where the separator character for subunits was ‘__’ (two
underscores), specs were identified by adding ‘_.ADA’, bodies by adding
‘.ADA’, and subunits by adding ‘.SEP’.  All file names were upper case.
Child units were not present of course since this was an Ada 83
compiler, but it seems reasonable to extend this scheme to use the same
double underscore separator for child units.

     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Spec_File_Name => "_.ADA",
        Dot_Replacement => "__",
        Casing = Uppercase);
     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Body_File_Name => ".ADA",
        Dot_Replacement => "__",
        Casing = Uppercase);
     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Subunit_File_Name => ".SEP",

3.3.4.1 Arbitrary File Naming Conventions
.........................................

The GNAT compiler must be able to know the source file name of a
compilation unit.  When using the standard GNAT default file naming
conventions (‘.ads’ for specs, ‘.adb’ for bodies), the GNAT compiler
does not need additional information.

When the source file names do not follow the standard GNAT default file
naming conventions, the GNAT compiler must be given additional
information through a configuration pragmas file (*note Configuration
Pragmas: 25.) or a project file.  When the non-standard file naming
conventions are well-defined, a small number of pragmas
‘Source_File_Name’ specifying a naming pattern (*note Alternative File
Naming Schemes: 40.) may be sufficient.  However, if the file naming
conventions are irregular or arbitrary, a number of pragma
‘Source_File_Name’ for individual compilation units must be defined.  To
help maintain the correspondence between compilation unit names and
source file names within the compiler, GNAT provides a tool ‘gnatname’
to generate the required pragmas for a set of files.

3.3.4.2 Running ‘gnatname’
..........................

The usual form of the ‘gnatname’ command is:

     $ gnatname [ switches ]  naming_pattern  [ naming_patterns ]
         [--and [ switches ]  naming_pattern  [ naming_patterns ]]

All of the arguments are optional.  If invoked without any argument,
‘gnatname’ will display its usage.

When used with at least one naming pattern, ‘gnatname’ will attempt to
find all the compilation units in files that follow at least one of the
naming patterns.  To find these compilation units, ‘gnatname’ will use
the GNAT compiler in syntax-check-only mode on all regular files.

One or several Naming Patterns may be given as arguments to ‘gnatname’.
Each Naming Pattern is enclosed between double quotes (or single quotes
on Windows).  A Naming Pattern is a regular expression similar to the
wildcard patterns used in file names by the Unix shells or the DOS
prompt.

‘gnatname’ may be called with several sections of directories/patterns.
Sections are separated by the switch ‘--and’.  In each section, there
must be at least one pattern.  If no directory is specified in a
section, the current directory (or the project directory if ‘-P’ is
used) is implied.  The options other that the directory switches and the
patterns apply globally even if they are in different sections.

Examples of Naming Patterns are:

     "*.[12].ada"
     "*.ad[sb]*"
     "body_*"    "spec_*"

For a more complete description of the syntax of Naming Patterns, see
the second kind of regular expressions described in ‘g-regexp.ads’ (the
‘Glob’ regular expressions).

When invoked without the switch ‘-P’, ‘gnatname’ will create a
configuration pragmas file ‘gnat.adc’ in the current working directory,
with pragmas ‘Source_File_Name’ for each file that contains a valid Ada
unit.

3.3.4.3 Switches for ‘gnatname’
...............................

Switches for ‘gnatname’ must precede any specified Naming Pattern.

You may specify any of the following switches to ‘gnatname’:

‘--version’

     Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

‘--help’

     If ‘--version’ was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
     all other options.

‘--subdirs=`dir'’

     Real object, library or exec directories are subdirectories <dir>
     of the specified ones.

‘--no-backup’

     Do not create a backup copy of an existing project file.

‘--and’

     Start another section of directories/patterns.

‘-c`filename'’

     Create a configuration pragmas file ‘filename’ (instead of the
     default ‘gnat.adc’).  There may be zero, one or more space between
     ‘-c’ and ‘filename’.  ‘filename’ may include directory information.
     ‘filename’ must be writable.  There may be only one switch ‘-c’.
     When a switch ‘-c’ is specified, no switch ‘-P’ may be specified
     (see below).

‘-d`dir'’

     Look for source files in directory ‘dir’.  There may be zero, one
     or more spaces between ‘-d’ and ‘dir’.  ‘dir’ may end with ‘/**’,
     that is it may be of the form ‘root_dir/**’.  In this case, the
     directory ‘root_dir’ and all of its subdirectories, recursively,
     have to be searched for sources.  When a switch ‘-d’ is specified,
     the current working directory will not be searched for source
     files, unless it is explicitly specified with a ‘-d’ or ‘-D’
     switch.  Several switches ‘-d’ may be specified.  If ‘dir’ is a
     relative path, it is relative to the directory of the configuration
     pragmas file specified with switch ‘-c’, or to the directory of the
     project file specified with switch ‘-P’ or, if neither switch ‘-c’
     nor switch ‘-P’ are specified, it is relative to the current
     working directory.  The directory specified with switch ‘-d’ must
     exist and be readable.

‘-D`filename'’

     Look for source files in all directories listed in text file
     ‘filename’.  There may be zero, one or more spaces between ‘-D’ and
     ‘filename’.  ‘filename’ must be an existing, readable text file.
     Each nonempty line in ‘filename’ must be a directory.  Specifying
     switch ‘-D’ is equivalent to specifying as many switches ‘-d’ as
     there are nonempty lines in ‘file’.

‘-eL’

     Follow symbolic links when processing project files.

‘-f`pattern'’

     Foreign patterns.  Using this switch, it is possible to add sources
     of languages other than Ada to the list of sources of a project
     file.  It is only useful if a -P switch is used.  For example,

          gnatname -Pprj -f"*.c" "*.ada"

     will look for Ada units in all files with the ‘.ada’ extension, and
     will add to the list of file for project ‘prj.gpr’ the C files with
     extension ‘.c’.

‘-h’

     Output usage (help) information.  The output is written to
     ‘stdout’.

‘-P`proj'’

     Create or update project file ‘proj’.  There may be zero, one or
     more space between ‘-P’ and ‘proj’.  ‘proj’ may include directory
     information.  ‘proj’ must be writable.  There may be only one
     switch ‘-P’.  When a switch ‘-P’ is specified, no switch ‘-c’ may
     be specified.  On all platforms, except on VMS, when ‘gnatname’ is
     invoked for an existing project file <proj>.gpr, a backup copy of
     the project file is created in the project directory with file name
     <proj>.gpr.saved_x.  ‘x’ is the first non negative number that
     makes this backup copy a new file.

‘-v’

     Verbose mode.  Output detailed explanation of behavior to ‘stdout’.
     This includes name of the file written, the name of the directories
     to search and, for each file in those directories whose name
     matches at least one of the Naming Patterns, an indication of
     whether the file contains a unit, and if so the name of the unit.

‘-v -v’

     Very Verbose mode.  In addition to the output produced in verbose
     mode, for each file in the searched directories whose name matches
     none of the Naming Patterns, an indication is given that there is
     no match.

‘-x`pattern'’

     Excluded patterns.  Using this switch, it is possible to exclude
     some files that would match the name patterns.  For example,

          gnatname -x "*_nt.ada" "*.ada"

     will look for Ada units in all files with the ‘.ada’ extension,
     except those whose names end with ‘_nt.ada’.

3.3.4.4 Examples of ‘gnatname’ Usage
....................................

     $ gnatname -c /home/me/names.adc -d sources "[a-z]*.ada*"

In this example, the directory ‘/home/me’ must already exist and be
writable.  In addition, the directory ‘/home/me/sources’ (specified by
‘-d sources’) must exist and be readable.

Note the optional spaces after ‘-c’ and ‘-d’.

     $ gnatname -P/home/me/proj -x "*_nt_body.ada"
     -dsources -dsources/plus -Dcommon_dirs.txt "body_*" "spec_*"

Note that several switches ‘-d’ may be used, even in conjunction with
one or several switches ‘-D’.  Several Naming Patterns and one excluded
pattern are used in this example.

3.3.5 File Name Krunching with ‘gnatkr’
---------------------------------------

This section discusses the method used by the compiler to shorten the
default file names chosen for Ada units so that they do not exceed the
maximum length permitted.  It also describes the ‘gnatkr’ utility that
can be used to determine the result of applying this shortening.

3.3.5.1 About ‘gnatkr’
......................

The default file naming rule in GNAT is that the file name must be
derived from the unit name.  The exact default rule is as follows:

   * Take the unit name and replace all dots by hyphens.

   * If such a replacement occurs in the second character position of a
     name, and the first character is ‘a’, ‘g’, ‘s’, or ‘i’, then
     replace the dot by the character ‘~’ (tilde) instead of a minus.

     The reason for this exception is to avoid clashes with the standard
     names for children of System, Ada, Interfaces, and GNAT, which use
     the prefixes ‘s-’, ‘a-’, ‘i-’, and ‘g-’, respectively.

The ‘-gnatk`nn'’ switch of the compiler activates a ‘krunching’ circuit
that limits file names to nn characters (where nn is a decimal integer).

The ‘gnatkr’ utility can be used to determine the krunched name for a
given file, when krunched to a specified maximum length.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Using gnatkr,  Next: Krunching Method,  Prev: About gnatkr,  Up: File Name Krunching with gnatkr

3.3.5.2 Using ‘gnatkr’
......................

The ‘gnatkr’ command has the form:

     $ gnatkr name [ length ]

‘name’ is the uncrunched file name, derived from the name of the unit in
the standard manner described in the previous section (i.e., in
particular all dots are replaced by hyphens).  The file name may or may
not have an extension (defined as a suffix of the form period followed
by arbitrary characters other than period).  If an extension is present
then it will be preserved in the output.  For example, when krunching
‘hellofile.ads’ to eight characters, the result will be hellofil.ads.

Note: for compatibility with previous versions of ‘gnatkr’ dots may
appear in the name instead of hyphens, but the last dot will always be
taken as the start of an extension.  So if ‘gnatkr’ is given an argument
such as ‘Hello.World.adb’ it will be treated exactly as if the first
period had been a hyphen, and for example krunching to eight characters
gives the result ‘hellworl.adb’.

Note that the result is always all lower case.  Characters of the other
case are folded as required.

‘length’ represents the length of the krunched name.  The default when
no argument is given is 8 characters.  A length of zero stands for
unlimited, in other words do not chop except for system files where the
implied crunching length is always eight characters.

The output is the krunched name.  The output has an extension only if
the original argument was a file name with an extension.

3.3.5.3 Krunching Method
........................

The initial file name is determined by the name of the unit that the
file contains.  The name is formed by taking the full expanded name of
the unit and replacing the separating dots with hyphens and using
lowercase for all letters, except that a hyphen in the second character
position is replaced by a tilde if the first character is ‘a’, ‘i’, ‘g’,
or ‘s’.  The extension is ‘.ads’ for a spec and ‘.adb’ for a body.
Krunching does not affect the extension, but the file name is shortened
to the specified length by following these rules:

   * The name is divided into segments separated by hyphens, tildes or
     underscores and all hyphens, tildes, and underscores are
     eliminated.  If this leaves the name short enough, we are done.

   * If the name is too long, the longest segment is located (left-most
     if there are two of equal length), and shortened by dropping its
     last character.  This is repeated until the name is short enough.

     As an example, consider the krunching of
     ‘our-strings-wide_fixed.adb’ to fit the name into 8 characters as
     required by some operating systems:

          our-strings-wide_fixed 22
          our strings wide fixed 19
          our string  wide fixed 18
          our strin   wide fixed 17
          our stri    wide fixed 16
          our stri    wide fixe  15
          our str     wide fixe  14
          our str     wid  fixe  13
          our str     wid  fix   12
          ou  str     wid  fix   11
          ou  st      wid  fix   10
          ou  st      wi   fix   9
          ou  st      wi   fi    8
          Final file name: oustwifi.adb

   * The file names for all predefined units are always krunched to
     eight characters.  The krunching of these predefined units uses the
     following special prefix replacements:

     Prefix                    Replacement
                               
                               
     ‘ada-’                    ‘a-’
                               
                               
     ‘gnat-’                   ‘g-’
                               
                               
     ‘interfac es-’            ‘i-’
                               
                               
     ‘system-’                 ‘s-’
                               

     These system files have a hyphen in the second character position.
     That is why normal user files replace such a character with a
     tilde, to avoid confusion with system file names.

     As an example of this special rule, consider
     ‘ada-strings-wide_fixed.adb’, which gets krunched as follows:

          ada-strings-wide_fixed 22
          a-  strings wide fixed 18
          a-  string  wide fixed 17
          a-  strin   wide fixed 16
          a-  stri    wide fixed 15
          a-  stri    wide fixe  14
          a-  str     wide fixe  13
          a-  str     wid  fixe  12
          a-  str     wid  fix   11
          a-  st      wid  fix   10
          a-  st      wi   fix   9
          a-  st      wi   fi    8
          Final file name: a-stwifi.adb

Of course no file shortening algorithm can guarantee uniqueness over all
possible unit names, and if file name krunching is used then it is your
responsibility to ensure that no name clashes occur.  The utility
program ‘gnatkr’ is supplied for conveniently determining the krunched
name of a file.

3.3.6 Renaming Files with ‘gnatchop’

This section discusses how to handle files with multiple units by using
the ‘gnatchop’ utility.  This utility is also useful in renaming files
to meet the standard GNAT default file naming conventions.

3.3.6.1 Handling Files with Multiple Units
..........................................

The basic compilation model of GNAT requires that a file submitted to
the compiler have only one unit and there be a strict correspondence
between the file name and the unit name.

If you want to keep your files with multiple units, perhaps to maintain
compatibility with some other Ada compilation system, you can use
‘gnatname’ to generate or update your project files.  Generated or
modified project files can be processed by GNAT.

See *note Handling Arbitrary File Naming Conventions with gnatname: 42.
for more details on how to use ‘gnatname’.

Alternatively, if you want to permanently restructure a set of ‘foreign’
files so that they match the GNAT rules, and do the remaining
development using the GNAT structure, you can simply use ‘gnatchop’
once, generate the new set of files and work with them from that point
on.

Note that if your file containing multiple units starts with a byte
order mark (BOM) specifying UTF-8 encoding, then the files generated by
gnatchop will each start with a copy of this BOM, meaning that they can
be compiled automatically in UTF-8 mode without needing to specify an
explicit encoding.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Operating gnatchop in Compilation Mode,  Next: Command Line for gnatchop,  Prev: Handling Files with Multiple Units,  Up: Renaming Files with gnatchop

3.3.6.2 Operating gnatchop in Compilation Mode
..............................................

The basic function of ‘gnatchop’ is to take a file with multiple units
and split it into separate files.  The boundary between files is
reasonably clear, except for the issue of comments and pragmas.  In
default mode, the rule is that any pragmas between units belong to the
previous unit, except that configuration pragmas always belong to the
following unit.  Any comments belong to the following unit.  These rules
almost always result in the right choice of the split point without
needing to mark it explicitly and most users will find this default to
be what they want.  In this default mode it is incorrect to submit a
file containing only configuration pragmas, or one that ends in
configuration pragmas, to ‘gnatchop’.

However, using a special option to activate ‘compilation mode’,
‘gnatchop’ can perform another function, which is to provide exactly the
semantics required by the RM for handling of configuration pragmas in a
compilation.  In the absence of configuration pragmas (at the main file
level), this option has no effect, but it causes such configuration
pragmas to be handled in a quite different manner.

First, in compilation mode, if ‘gnatchop’ is given a file that consists
of only configuration pragmas, then this file is appended to the
‘gnat.adc’ file in the current directory.  This behavior provides the
required behavior described in the RM for the actions to be taken on
submitting such a file to the compiler, namely that these pragmas should
apply to all subsequent compilations in the same compilation
environment.  Using GNAT, the current directory, possibly containing a
‘gnat.adc’ file is the representation of a compilation environment.  For
more information on the ‘gnat.adc’ file, see *note Handling of
Configuration Pragmas: 3f.

Second, in compilation mode, if ‘gnatchop’ is given a file that starts
with configuration pragmas, and contains one or more units, then these
configuration pragmas are prepended to each of the chopped files.  This
behavior provides the required behavior described in the RM for the
actions to be taken on compiling such a file, namely that the pragmas
apply to all units in the compilation, but not to subsequently compiled
units.

Finally, if configuration pragmas appear between units, they are
appended to the previous unit.  This results in the previous unit being
illegal, since the compiler does not accept configuration pragmas that
follow a unit.  This provides the required RM behavior that forbids
configuration pragmas other than those preceding the first compilation
unit of a compilation.

For most purposes, ‘gnatchop’ will be used in default mode.  The
compilation mode described above is used only if you need exactly
accurate behavior with respect to compilations, and you have files that
contain multiple units and configuration pragmas.  In this circumstance
the use of ‘gnatchop’ with the compilation mode switch provides the
required behavior, and is for example the mode in which GNAT processes
the ACVC tests.

3.3.6.3 Command Line for ‘gnatchop’
...................................

The ‘gnatchop’ command has the form:

     $ gnatchop switches file_name [file_name ...]
           [directory]

The only required argument is the file name of the file to be chopped.
There are no restrictions on the form of this file name.  The file
itself contains one or more Ada units, in normal GNAT format,
concatenated together.  As shown, more than one file may be presented to
be chopped.

When run in default mode, ‘gnatchop’ generates one output file in the
current directory for each unit in each of the files.

‘directory’, if specified, gives the name of the directory to which the
output files will be written.  If it is not specified, all files are
written to the current directory.

For example, given a file called ‘hellofiles’ containing

     procedure Hello;

     with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
     procedure Hello is
     begin
        Put_Line ("Hello");
     end Hello;

the command

     $ gnatchop hellofiles

generates two files in the current directory, one called ‘hello.ads’
containing the single line that is the procedure spec, and the other
called ‘hello.adb’ containing the remaining text.  The original file is
not affected.  The generated files can be compiled in the normal manner.

When gnatchop is invoked on a file that is empty or that contains only
empty lines and/or comments, gnatchop will not fail, but will not
produce any new sources.

For example, given a file called ‘toto.txt’ containing

     --  Just a comment

the command

     $ gnatchop toto.txt

will not produce any new file and will result in the following warnings:

     toto.txt:1:01: warning: empty file, contains no compilation units
     no compilation units found
     no source files written

3.3.6.4 Switches for ‘gnatchop’
...............................

‘gnatchop’ recognizes the following switches:

‘--version’

     Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

‘--help’

     If ‘--version’ was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
     all other options.

‘-c’

     Causes ‘gnatchop’ to operate in compilation mode, in which
     configuration pragmas are handled according to strict RM rules.
     See previous section for a full description of this mode.

‘-gnat`xxx'’

     This passes the given ‘-gnat`xxx'’ switch to ‘gnat’ which is used
     to parse the given file.  Not all ‘xxx’ options make sense, but for
     example, the use of ‘-gnati2’ allows ‘gnatchop’ to process a source
     file that uses Latin-2 coding for identifiers.

‘-h’

     Causes ‘gnatchop’ to generate a brief help summary to the standard
     output file showing usage information.

‘-k`mm'’

     Limit generated file names to the specified number ‘mm’ of
     characters.  This is useful if the resulting set of files is
     required to be interoperable with systems which limit the length of
     file names.  No space is allowed between the ‘-k’ and the numeric
     value.  The numeric value may be omitted in which case a default of
     ‘-k8’, suitable for use with DOS-like file systems, is used.  If no
     ‘-k’ switch is present then there is no limit on the length of file
     names.

‘-p’

     Causes the file modification time stamp of the input file to be
     preserved and used for the time stamp of the output file(s).  This
     may be useful for preserving coherency of time stamps in an
     environment where ‘gnatchop’ is used as part of a standard build
     process.

‘-q’

     Causes output of informational messages indicating the set of
     generated files to be suppressed.  Warnings and error messages are
     unaffected.

‘-r’

     Generate ‘Source_Reference’ pragmas.  Use this switch if the output
     files are regarded as temporary and development is to be done in
     terms of the original unchopped file.  This switch causes
     ‘Source_Reference’ pragmas to be inserted into each of the
     generated files to refers back to the original file name and line
     number.  The result is that all error messages refer back to the
     original unchopped file.  In addition, the debugging information
     placed into the object file (when the ‘-g’ switch of ‘gcc’ or
     ‘gnatmake’ is specified) also refers back to this original file so
     that tools like profilers and debuggers will give information in
     terms of the original unchopped file.

     If the original file to be chopped itself contains a
     ‘Source_Reference’ pragma referencing a third file, then gnatchop
     respects this pragma, and the generated ‘Source_Reference’ pragmas
     in the chopped file refer to the original file, with appropriate
     line numbers.  This is particularly useful when ‘gnatchop’ is used
     in conjunction with ‘gnatprep’ to compile files that contain
     preprocessing statements and multiple units.

‘-v’

     Causes ‘gnatchop’ to operate in verbose mode.  The version number
     and copyright notice are output, as well as exact copies of the
     gnat1 commands spawned to obtain the chop control information.

‘-w’

     Overwrite existing file names.  Normally ‘gnatchop’ regards it as a
     fatal error if there is already a file with the same name as a file
     it would otherwise output, in other words if the files to be
     chopped contain duplicated units.  This switch bypasses this check,
     and causes all but the last instance of such duplicated units to be
     skipped.

‘--GCC=`xxxx'’

     Specify the path of the GNAT parser to be used.  When this switch
     is used, no attempt is made to add the prefix to the GNAT parser
     executable.

3.3.6.5 Examples of ‘gnatchop’ Usage
....................................

     $ gnatchop -w hello_s.ada prerelease/files

Chops the source file ‘hello_s.ada’.  The output files will be placed in
the directory ‘prerelease/files’, overwriting any files with matching
names in that directory (no files in the current directory are
modified).

     $ gnatchop archive

Chops the source file ‘archive’ into the current directory.  One useful
application of ‘gnatchop’ is in sending sets of sources around, for
example in email messages.  The required sources are simply concatenated
(for example, using a Unix ‘cat’ command), and then ‘gnatchop’ is used
at the other end to reconstitute the original file names.

     $ gnatchop file1 file2 file3 direc

Chops all units in files ‘file1’, ‘file2’, ‘file3’, placing the
resulting files in the directory ‘direc’.  Note that if any units occur
more than once anywhere within this set of files, an error message is
generated, and no files are written.  To override this check, use the
‘-w’ switch, in which case the last occurrence in the last file will be
the one that is output, and earlier duplicate occurrences for a given
unit will be skipped.

3.4.1 Handling of Configuration Pragmas
---------------------------------------

Configuration pragmas may either appear at the start of a compilation
unit, or they can appear in a configuration pragma file to apply to all
compilations performed in a given compilation environment.

GNAT also provides the ‘gnatchop’ utility to provide an automatic way to
handle configuration pragmas following the semantics for compilations
(that is, files with multiple units), described in the RM. See *note
Operating gnatchop in Compilation Mode: 59. for details.  However, for
most purposes, it will be more convenient to edit the ‘gnat.adc’ file
that contains configuration pragmas directly, as described in the
following section.

In the case of ‘Restrictions’ pragmas appearing as configuration pragmas
in individual compilation units, the exact handling depends on the type
of restriction.

Restrictions that require partition-wide consistency (like ‘No_Tasking’)
are recognized wherever they appear and can be freely inherited, e.g.
from a ‘with’ed unit to the ‘with’ing unit.  This makes sense since the
binder will in any case insist on seeing consistent use, so any unit not
conforming to any restrictions that are anywhere in the partition will
be rejected, and you might as well find that out at compile time rather
than at bind time.

For restrictions that do not require partition-wide consistency, e.g.
SPARK or No_Implementation_Attributes, in general the restriction
applies only to the unit in which the pragma appears, and not to any
other units.

The exception is No_Elaboration_Code which always applies to the entire
object file from a compilation, i.e.  to the body, spec, and all
subunits.  This restriction can be specified in a configuration pragma
file, or it can be on the body and/or the spec (in either case it
applies to all the relevant units).  It can appear on a subunit only if
it has previously appeared in the body of spec.

3.4.2 The Configuration Pragmas Files
-------------------------------------

In GNAT a compilation environment is defined by the current directory at
the time that a compile command is given.  This current directory is
searched for a file whose name is ‘gnat.adc’.  If this file is present,
it is expected to contain one or more configuration pragmas that will be
applied to the current compilation.  However, if the switch ‘-gnatA’ is
used, ‘gnat.adc’ is not considered.  When taken into account, ‘gnat.adc’
is added to the dependencies, so that if ‘gnat.adc’ is modified later,
an invocation of ‘gnatmake’ will recompile the source.

Configuration pragmas may be entered into the ‘gnat.adc’ file either by
running ‘gnatchop’ on a source file that consists only of configuration
pragmas, or more conveniently by direct editing of the ‘gnat.adc’ file,
which is a standard format source file.

Besides ‘gnat.adc’, additional files containing configuration pragmas
may be applied to the current compilation using the switch
‘-gnatec=`path'’ where ‘path’ must designate an existing file that
contains only configuration pragmas.  These configuration pragmas are in
addition to those found in ‘gnat.adc’ (provided ‘gnat.adc’ is present
and switch ‘-gnatA’ is not used).

It is allowable to specify several switches ‘-gnatec=’, all of which
will be taken into account.

Files containing configuration pragmas specified with switches
‘-gnatec=’ are added to the dependencies, unless they are temporary
files.  A file is considered temporary if its name ends in ‘.tmp’ or
‘.TMP’.  Certain tools follow this naming convention because they pass
information to ‘gcc’ via temporary files that are immediately deleted;
it doesn’t make sense to depend on a file that no longer exists.  Such
tools include ‘gprbuild’, ‘gnatmake’, and ‘gnatcheck’.

By default, configuration pragma files are stored by their absolute
paths in ALI files.  You can use the ‘-gnateb’ switch in order to store
them by their basename instead.

If you are using project file, a separate mechanism is provided using
project attributes.

3.5 Generating Object Files
===========================

An Ada program consists of a set of source files, and the first step in
compiling the program is to generate the corresponding object files.
These are generated by compiling a subset of these source files.  The
files you need to compile are the following:

   * If a package spec has no body, compile the package spec to produce
     the object file for the package.

   * If a package has both a spec and a body, compile the body to
     produce the object file for the package.  The source file for the
     package spec need not be compiled in this case because there is
     only one object file, which contains the code for both the spec and
     body of the package.

   * For a subprogram, compile the subprogram body to produce the object
     file for the subprogram.  The spec, if one is present, is as usual
     in a separate file, and need not be compiled.

   * In the case of subunits, only compile the parent unit.  A single
     object file is generated for the entire subunit tree, which
     includes all the subunits.

   * Compile child units independently of their parent units (though, of
     course, the spec of all the ancestor unit must be present in order
     to compile a child unit).

   * Compile generic units in the same manner as any other units.  The
     object files in this case are small dummy files that contain at
     most the flag used for elaboration checking.  This is because GNAT
     always handles generic instantiation by means of macro expansion.
     However, it is still necessary to compile generic units, for
     dependency checking and elaboration purposes.

The preceding rules describe the set of files that must be compiled to
generate the object files for a program.  Each object file has the same
name as the corresponding source file, except that the extension is ‘.o’
as usual.

You may wish to compile other files for the purpose of checking their
syntactic and semantic correctness.  For example, in the case where a
package has a separate spec and body, you would not normally compile the
spec.  However, it is convenient in practice to compile the spec to make
sure it is error-free before compiling clients of this spec, because
such compilations will fail if there is an error in the spec.

GNAT provides an option for compiling such files purely for the purposes
of checking correctness; such compilations are not required as part of
the process of building a program.  To compile a file in this checking
mode, use the ‘-gnatc’ switch.

3.6 Source Dependencies
=======================

A given object file clearly depends on the source file which is compiled
to produce it.  Here we are using “depends” in the sense of a typical
‘make’ utility; in other words, an object file depends on a source file
if changes to the source file require the object file to be recompiled.
In addition to this basic dependency, a given object may depend on
additional source files as follows:

   * If a file being compiled ‘with’s a unit ‘X’, the object file
     depends on the file containing the spec of unit ‘X’.  This includes
     files that are ‘with’ed implicitly either because they are parents
     of ‘with’ed child units or they are run-time units required by the
     language constructs used in a particular unit.

   * If a file being compiled instantiates a library level generic unit,
     the object file depends on both the spec and body files for this
     generic unit.

   * If a file being compiled instantiates a generic unit defined within
     a package, the object file depends on the body file for the package
     as well as the spec file.

   * If a file being compiled contains a call to a subprogram for which
     pragma ‘Inline’ applies and inlining is activated with the ‘-gnatn’
     switch, the object file depends on the file containing the body of
     this subprogram as well as on the file containing the spec.  Note
     that for inlining to actually occur as a result of the use of this
     switch, it is necessary to compile in optimizing mode.

     The use of ‘-gnatN’ activates inlining optimization that is
     performed by the front end of the compiler.  This inlining does not
     require that the code generation be optimized.  Like ‘-gnatn’, the
     use of this switch generates additional dependencies.

     When using a gcc-based back end, then the use of ‘-gnatN’ is
     deprecated, and the use of ‘-gnatn’ is preferred.  Historically
     front end inlining was more extensive than the gcc back end
     inlining, but that is no longer the case.

   * If an object file ‘O’ depends on the proper body of a subunit
     through inlining or instantiation, it depends on the parent unit of
     the subunit.  This means that any modification of the parent unit
     or one of its subunits affects the compilation of ‘O’.

   * The object file for a parent unit depends on all its subunit body
     files.

   * The previous two rules meant that for purposes of computing
     dependencies and recompilation, a body and all its subunits are
     treated as an indivisible whole.

     These rules are applied transitively: if unit ‘A’ ‘with’s unit ‘B’,
     whose elaboration calls an inlined procedure in package ‘C’, the
     object file for unit ‘A’ will depend on the body of ‘C’, in file
     ‘c.adb’.

     The set of dependent files described by these rules includes all
     the files on which the unit is semantically dependent, as dictated
     by the Ada language standard.  However, it is a superset of what
     the standard describes, because it includes generic, inline, and
     subunit dependencies.

     An object file must be recreated by recompiling the corresponding
     source file if any of the source files on which it depends are
     modified.  For example, if the ‘make’ utility is used to control
     compilation, the rule for an Ada object file must mention all the
     source files on which the object file depends, according to the
     above definition.  The determination of the necessary
     recompilations is done automatically when one uses ‘gnatmake’.

3.7 The Ada Library Information Files
=====================================

Each compilation actually generates two output files.  The first of
these is the normal object file that has a ‘.o’ extension.  The second
is a text file containing full dependency information.  It has the same
name as the source file, but an ‘.ali’ extension.  This file is known as
the Ada Library Information (‘ALI’) file.  The following information is
contained in the ‘ALI’ file.

   * Version information (indicates which version of GNAT was used to
     compile the unit(s) in question)

   * Main program information (including priority and time slice
     settings, as well as the wide character encoding used during
     compilation).

   * List of arguments used in the ‘gcc’ command for the compilation

   * Attributes of the unit, including configuration pragmas used, an
     indication of whether the compilation was successful, exception
     model used etc.

   * A list of relevant restrictions applying to the unit (used for
     consistency) checking.

   * Categorization information (e.g., use of pragma ‘Pure’).

   * Information on all ‘with’ed units, including presence of
     ‘Elaborate’ or ‘Elaborate_All’ pragmas.

   * Information from any ‘Linker_Options’ pragmas used in the unit

   * Information on the use of ‘Body_Version’ or ‘Version’ attributes in
     the unit.

   * Dependency information.  This is a list of files, together with
     time stamp and checksum information.  These are files on which the
     unit depends in the sense that recompilation is required if any of
     these units are modified.

   * Cross-reference data.  Contains information on all entities
     referenced in the unit.  Used by some tools to provide
     cross-reference information.

For a full detailed description of the format of the ‘ALI’ file, see the
source of the body of unit ‘Lib.Writ’, contained in file ‘lib-writ.adb’
in the GNAT compiler sources.

3.8 Binding an Ada Program
==========================

When using languages such as C and C++, once the source files have been
compiled the only remaining step in building an executable program is
linking the object modules together.  This means that it is possible to
link an inconsistent version of a program, in which two units have
included different versions of the same header.

The rules of Ada do not permit such an inconsistent program to be built.
For example, if two clients have different versions of the same package,
it is illegal to build a program containing these two clients.  These
rules are enforced by the GNAT binder, which also determines an
elaboration order consistent with the Ada rules.

The GNAT binder is run after all the object files for a program have
been created.  It is given the name of the main program unit, and from
this it determines the set of units required by the program, by reading
the corresponding ALI files.  It generates error messages if the program
is inconsistent or if no valid order of elaboration exists.

If no errors are detected, the binder produces a main program, in Ada by
default, that contains calls to the elaboration procedures of those
compilation unit that require them, followed by a call to the main
program.  This Ada program is compiled to generate the object file for
the main program.  The name of the Ada file is ‘b~xxx.adb’ (with the
corresponding spec ‘b~xxx.ads’) where ‘xxx’ is the name of the main
program unit.

Finally, the linker is used to build the resulting executable program,
using the object from the main program from the bind step as well as the
object files for the Ada units of the program.

3.9 GNAT and Libraries
======================

This section describes how to build and use libraries with GNAT, and
also shows how to recompile the GNAT run-time library.  You should be
familiar with the Project Manager facility (see the
‘GNAT_Project_Manager’ chapter of the ‘GPRbuild User’s Guide’) before
reading this chapter.

3.9.1 Introduction to Libraries in GNAT
---------------------------------------

A library is, conceptually, a collection of objects which does not have
its own main thread of execution, but rather provides certain services
to the applications that use it.  A library can be either statically
linked with the application, in which case its code is directly included
in the application, or, on platforms that support it, be dynamically
linked, in which case its code is shared by all applications making use
of this library.

GNAT supports both types of libraries.  In the static case, the compiled
code can be provided in different ways.  The simplest approach is to
provide directly the set of objects resulting from compilation of the
library source files.  Alternatively, you can group the objects into an
archive using whatever commands are provided by the operating system.
For the latter case, the objects are grouped into a shared library.

In the GNAT environment, a library has three types of components:

   * Source files,

   * ‘ALI’ files (see *note The Ada Library Information Files: 28.), and

   * Object files, an archive or a shared library.

A GNAT library may expose all its source files, which is useful for
documentation purposes.  Alternatively, it may expose only the units
needed by an external user to make use of the library.  That is to say,
the specs reflecting the library services along with all the units
needed to compile those specs, which can include generic bodies or any
body implementing an inlined routine.  In the case of ‘stand-alone
libraries’ those exposed units are called ‘interface units’ (*note
Stand-alone Ada Libraries: 6b.).

All compilation units comprising an application, including those in a
library, need to be elaborated in an order partially defined by Ada’s
semantics.  GNAT computes the elaboration order from the ‘ALI’ files and
this is why they constitute a mandatory part of GNAT libraries.
‘Stand-alone libraries’ are the exception to this rule because a
specific library elaboration routine is produced independently of the
application(s) using the library.

3.9.2.1 Building a library
..........................

The easiest way to build a library is to use the Project Manager, which
supports a special type of project called a ‘Library Project’ (see the
‘Library Projects’ section in the ‘GNAT Project Manager’ chapter of the
‘GPRbuild User’s Guide’).

A project is considered a library project, when two project-level
attributes are defined in it: ‘Library_Name’ and ‘Library_Dir’.  In
order to control different aspects of library configuration, additional
optional project-level attributes can be specified:

   * 
     ‘Library_Kind’

          This attribute controls whether the library is to be static or
          dynamic

   * 
     ‘Library_Version’

          This attribute specifies the library version; this value is
          used during dynamic linking of shared libraries to determine
          if the currently installed versions of the binaries are
          compatible.

   * ‘Library_Options’

   * 
     ‘Library_GCC’

          These attributes specify additional low-level options to be
          used during library generation, and redefine the actual
          application used to generate library.

The GNAT Project Manager takes full care of the library maintenance
task, including recompilation of the source files for which objects do
not exist or are not up to date, assembly of the library archive, and
installation of the library (i.e., copying associated source, object and
‘ALI’ files to the specified location).

Here is a simple library project file:

     project My_Lib is
       for Source_Dirs use ("src1", "src2");
       for Object_Dir use "obj";
       for Library_Name use "mylib";
       for Library_Dir use "lib";
       for Library_Kind use "dynamic";
     end My_lib;

and the compilation command to build and install the library:

     $ gnatmake -Pmy_lib

It is not entirely trivial to perform manually all the steps required to
produce a library.  We recommend that you use the GNAT Project Manager
for this task.  In special cases where this is not desired, the
necessary steps are discussed below.

There are various possibilities for compiling the units that make up the
library: for example with a Makefile (*note Using the GNU make Utility:
70.) or with a conventional script.  For simple libraries, it is also
possible to create a dummy main program which depends upon all the
packages that comprise the interface of the library.  This dummy main
program can then be given to ‘gnatmake’, which will ensure that all
necessary objects are built.

After this task is accomplished, you should follow the standard
procedure of the underlying operating system to produce the static or
shared library.

Here is an example of such a dummy program:

     with My_Lib.Service1;
     with My_Lib.Service2;
     with My_Lib.Service3;
     procedure My_Lib_Dummy is
     begin
        null;
     end;

Here are the generic commands that will build an archive or a shared
library.

     # compiling the library
     $ gnatmake -c my_lib_dummy.adb

     # we don't need the dummy object itself
     $ rm my_lib_dummy.o my_lib_dummy.ali

     # create an archive with the remaining objects
     $ ar rc libmy_lib.a *.o
     # some systems may require "ranlib" to be run as well

     # or create a shared library
     $ gcc -shared -o libmy_lib.so *.o
     # some systems may require the code to have been compiled with -fPIC

     # remove the object files that are now in the library
     $ rm *.o

     # Make the ALI files read-only so that gnatmake will not try to
     # regenerate the objects that are in the library
     $ chmod -w *.ali

Please note that the library must have a name of the form ‘lib`xxx'.a’
or ‘lib`xxx'.so’ (or ‘lib`xxx'.dll’ on Windows) in order to be accessed
by the directive ‘-l`xxx'’ at link time.

3.9.2.2 Installing a library
............................

If you use project files, library installation is part of the library
build process (see the ‘Installing a Library with Project Files’ section
of the ‘GNAT Project Manager’ chapter of the ‘GPRbuild User’s Guide’).

When project files are not an option, it is also possible, but not
recommended, to install the library so that the sources needed to use
the library are on the Ada source path and the ALI files & libraries be
on the Ada Object path (see *note Search Paths and the Run-Time Library
(RTL): 73.).  Alternatively, the system administrator can place
general-purpose libraries in the default compiler paths, by specifying
the libraries’ location in the configuration files ‘ada_source_path’ and
‘ada_object_path’.  These configuration files must be located in the
GNAT installation tree at the same place as the gcc spec file.  The
location of the gcc spec file can be determined as follows:

     $ gcc -v

The configuration files mentioned above have a simple format: each line
must contain one unique directory name.  Those names are added to the
corresponding path in their order of appearance in the file.  The names
can be either absolute or relative; in the latter case, they are
relative to where theses files are located.

The files ‘ada_source_path’ and ‘ada_object_path’ might not be present
in a GNAT installation, in which case, GNAT will look for its run-time
library in the directories ‘adainclude’ (for the sources) and ‘adalib’
(for the objects and ‘ALI’ files).  When the files exist, the compiler
does not look in ‘adainclude’ and ‘adalib’, and thus the
‘ada_source_path’ file must contain the location for the GNAT run-time
sources (which can simply be ‘adainclude’).  In the same way, the
‘ada_object_path’ file must contain the location for the GNAT run-time
objects (which can simply be ‘adalib’).

You can also specify a new default path to the run-time library at
compilation time with the switch ‘--RTS=rts-path’.  You can thus choose
/ change the run-time library you want your program to be compiled with.
This switch is recognized by ‘gcc’, ‘gnatmake’, ‘gnatbind’, ‘gnatls’,
and all project aware tools.

It is possible to install a library before or after the standard GNAT
library, by reordering the lines in the configuration files.  In
general, a library must be installed before the GNAT library if it
redefines any part of it.

3.9.2.3 Using a library
.......................

Once again, the project facility greatly simplifies the use of
libraries.  In this context, using a library is just a matter of adding
a ‘with’ clause in the user project.  For instance, to make use of the
library ‘My_Lib’ shown in examples in earlier sections, you can write:

     with "my_lib";
     project My_Proj is
       ...
     end My_Proj;

Even if you have a third-party, non-Ada library, you can still use
GNAT’s Project Manager facility to provide a wrapper for it.  For
example, the following project, when ‘with’ed by your main project, will
link with the third-party library ‘liba.a’:

     project Liba is
        for Externally_Built use "true";
        for Source_Files use ();
        for Library_Dir use "lib";
        for Library_Name use "a";
        for Library_Kind use "static";
     end Liba;

This is an alternative to the use of ‘pragma Linker_Options’.  It is
especially interesting in the context of systems with several
interdependent static libraries where finding a proper linker order is
not easy and best be left to the tools having visibility over project
dependence information.

In order to use an Ada library manually, you need to make sure that this
library is on both your source and object path (see *note Search Paths
and the Run-Time Library (RTL): 73. and *note Search Paths for gnatbind:
76.).  Furthermore, when the objects are grouped in an archive or a
shared library, you need to specify the desired library at link time.

For example, you can use the library ‘mylib’ installed in
‘/dir/my_lib_src’ and ‘/dir/my_lib_obj’ with the following commands:

     $ gnatmake -aI/dir/my_lib_src -aO/dir/my_lib_obj my_appl \\
       -largs -lmy_lib

This can be expressed more simply:

     $ gnatmake my_appl

when the following conditions are met:

   * ‘/dir/my_lib_src’ has been added by the user to the environment
     variable ‘ADA_INCLUDE_PATH’, or by the administrator to the file
     ‘ada_source_path’

   * ‘/dir/my_lib_obj’ has been added by the user to the environment
     variable ‘ADA_OBJECTS_PATH’, or by the administrator to the file
     ‘ada_object_path’

   * a pragma ‘Linker_Options’ has been added to one of the sources.
     For example:

          pragma Linker_Options ("-lmy_lib");

Note that you may also load a library dynamically at run time given its
filename, as illustrated in the GNAT ‘plugins’ example in the directory
‘share/examples/gnat/plugins’ within the GNAT install area.

3.9.3.1 Introduction to Stand-alone Libraries
.............................................

A Stand-alone Library (abbreviated ‘SAL’) is a library that contains the
necessary code to elaborate the Ada units that are included in the
library.  In contrast with an ordinary library, which consists of all
sources, objects and ‘ALI’ files of the library, a SAL may specify a
restricted subset of compilation units to serve as a library interface.
In this case, the fully self-sufficient set of files will normally
consist of an objects archive, the sources of interface units’ specs,
and the ‘ALI’ files of interface units.  If an interface spec contains a
generic unit or an inlined subprogram, the body’s source must also be
provided; if the units that must be provided in the source form depend
on other units, the source and ‘ALI’ files of those must also be
provided.

The main purpose of a SAL is to minimize the recompilation overhead of
client applications when a new version of the library is installed.
Specifically, if the interface sources have not changed, client
applications do not need to be recompiled.  If, furthermore, a SAL is
provided in the shared form and its version, controlled by
‘Library_Version’ attribute, is not changed, then the clients do not
need to be relinked.

SALs also allow the library providers to minimize the amount of library
source text exposed to the clients.  Such ‘information hiding’ might be
useful or necessary for various reasons.

Stand-alone libraries are also well suited to be used in an executable
whose main routine is not written in Ada.

3.9.3.2 Building a Stand-alone Library
......................................

GNAT’s Project facility provides a simple way of building and installing
stand-alone libraries; see the ‘Stand-alone Library Projects’ section in
the ‘GNAT Project Manager’ chapter of the ‘GPRbuild User’s Guide’.  To
be a Stand-alone Library Project, in addition to the two attributes that
make a project a Library Project (‘Library_Name’ and ‘Library_Dir’; see
the ‘Library Projects’ section in the ‘GNAT Project Manager’ chapter of
the ‘GPRbuild User’s Guide’), the attribute ‘Library_Interface’ must be
defined.  For example:

     for Library_Dir use "lib_dir";
     for Library_Name use "dummy";
     for Library_Interface use ("int1", "int1.child");

Attribute ‘Library_Interface’ has a non-empty string list value, each
string in the list designating a unit contained in an immediate source
of the project file.

When a Stand-alone Library is built, first the binder is invoked to
build a package whose name depends on the library name (‘b~dummy.ads/b’
in the example above).  This binder-generated package includes
initialization and finalization procedures whose names depend on the
library name (‘dummyinit’ and ‘dummyfinal’ in the example above).  The
object corresponding to this package is included in the library.

You must ensure timely (e.g., prior to any use of interfaces in the SAL)
calling of these procedures if a static SAL is built, or if a shared SAL
is built with the project-level attribute ‘Library_Auto_Init’ set to
‘"false"’.

For a Stand-Alone Library, only the ‘ALI’ files of the Interface Units
(those that are listed in attribute ‘Library_Interface’) are copied to
the Library Directory.  As a consequence, only the Interface Units may
be imported from Ada units outside of the library.  If other units are
imported, the binding phase will fail.

It is also possible to build an encapsulated library where not only the
code to elaborate and finalize the library is embedded but also ensuring
that the library is linked only against static libraries.  So an
encapsulated library only depends on system libraries, all other code,
including the GNAT runtime, is embedded.  To build an encapsulated
library the attribute ‘Library_Standalone’ must be set to
‘encapsulated’:

     for Library_Dir use "lib_dir";
     for Library_Name use "dummy";
     for Library_Kind use "dynamic";
     for Library_Interface use ("int1", "int1.child");
     for Library_Standalone use "encapsulated";

The default value for this attribute is ‘standard’ in which case a
stand-alone library is built.

The attribute ‘Library_Src_Dir’ may be specified for a Stand-Alone
Library.  ‘Library_Src_Dir’ is a simple attribute that has a single
string value.  Its value must be the path (absolute or relative to the
project directory) of an existing directory.  This directory cannot be
the object directory or one of the source directories, but it can be the
same as the library directory.  The sources of the Interface Units of
the library that are needed by an Ada client of the library will be
copied to the designated directory, called the Interface Copy directory.
These sources include the specs of the Interface Units, but they may
also include bodies and subunits, when pragmas ‘Inline’ or
‘Inline_Always’ are used, or when there is a generic unit in the spec.
Before the sources are copied to the Interface Copy directory, an
attempt is made to delete all files in the Interface Copy directory.

Building stand-alone libraries by hand is somewhat tedious, but for
those occasions when it is necessary here are the steps that you need to
perform:

   * Compile all library sources.

   * Invoke the binder with the switch ‘-n’ (No Ada main program), with
     all the ‘ALI’ files of the interfaces, and with the switch ‘-L’ to
     give specific names to the ‘init’ and ‘final’ procedures.  For
     example:

          $ gnatbind -n int1.ali int2.ali -Lsal1

   * Compile the binder generated file:

          $ gcc -c b~int2.adb

   * Link the dynamic library with all the necessary object files,
     indicating to the linker the names of the ‘init’ (and possibly
     ‘final’) procedures for automatic initialization (and
     finalization).  The built library should be placed in a directory
     different from the object directory.

   * Copy the ‘ALI’ files of the interface to the library directory, add
     in this copy an indication that it is an interface to a SAL (i.e.,
     add a word ‘SL’ on the line in the ‘ALI’ file that starts with
     letter ‘P’) and make the modified copy of the ‘ALI’ file read-only.

Using SALs is not different from using other libraries (see *note Using
a library: 75.).

3.9.3.3 Creating a Stand-alone Library to be used in a non-Ada context
......................................................................

It is easy to adapt the SAL build procedure discussed above for use of a
SAL in a non-Ada context.

The only extra step required is to ensure that library interface
subprograms are compatible with the main program, by means of ‘pragma
Export’ or ‘pragma Convention’.

Here is an example of simple library interface for use with C main
program:

     package My_Package is

        procedure Do_Something;
        pragma Export (C, Do_Something, "do_something");

        procedure Do_Something_Else;
        pragma Export (C, Do_Something_Else, "do_something_else");

     end My_Package;

On the foreign language side, you must provide a ‘foreign’ view of the
library interface; remember that it should contain elaboration routines
in addition to interface subprograms.

The example below shows the content of ‘mylib_interface.h’ (note that
there is no rule for the naming of this file, any name can be used)

     /* the library elaboration procedure */
     extern void mylibinit (void);

     /* the library finalization procedure */
     extern void mylibfinal (void);

     /* the interface exported by the library */
     extern void do_something (void);
     extern void do_something_else (void);

Libraries built as explained above can be used from any program,
provided that the elaboration procedures (named ‘mylibinit’ in the
previous example) are called before the library services are used.  Any
number of libraries can be used simultaneously, as long as the
elaboration procedure of each library is called.

Below is an example of a C program that uses the ‘mylib’ library.

     #include "mylib_interface.h"

     int
     main (void)
     {
        /* First, elaborate the library before using it */
        mylibinit ();

        /* Main program, using the library exported entities */
        do_something ();
        do_something_else ();

        /* Library finalization at the end of the program */
        mylibfinal ();
        return 0;
     }

Note that invoking any library finalization procedure generated by
‘gnatbind’ shuts down the Ada run-time environment.  Consequently, the
finalization of all Ada libraries must be performed at the end of the
program.  No call to these libraries or to the Ada run-time library
should be made after the finalization phase.

Information on limitations of binding Ada code in non-Ada contexts can
be found under *note Binding with Non-Ada Main Programs: 7e.

Note also that special care must be taken with multi-tasks applications.
The initialization and finalization routines are not protected against
concurrent access.  If such requirement is needed it must be ensured at
the application level using a specific operating system services like a
mutex or a critical-section.

3.9.3.4 Restrictions in Stand-alone Libraries
.............................................

The pragmas listed below should be used with caution inside libraries,
as they can create incompatibilities with other Ada libraries:

   * pragma ‘Locking_Policy’

   * pragma ‘Partition_Elaboration_Policy’

   * pragma ‘Queuing_Policy’

   * pragma ‘Task_Dispatching_Policy’

   * pragma ‘Unreserve_All_Interrupts’

When using a library that contains such pragmas, the user must make sure
that all libraries use the same pragmas with the same values.
Otherwise, ‘Program_Error’ will be raised during the elaboration of the
conflicting libraries.  The usage of these pragmas and its consequences
for the user should therefore be well documented.

Similarly, the traceback in the exception occurrence mechanism should be
enabled or disabled in a consistent manner across all libraries.
Otherwise, Program_Error will be raised during the elaboration of the
conflicting libraries.

If the ‘Version’ or ‘Body_Version’ attributes are used inside a library,
then you need to perform a ‘gnatbind’ step that specifies all ‘ALI’
files in all libraries, so that version identifiers can be properly
computed.  In practice these attributes are rarely used, so this is
unlikely to be a consideration.

3.9.4 Rebuilding the GNAT Run-Time Library
------------------------------------------

It may be useful to recompile the GNAT library in various debugging or
experimentation contexts.  A project file called ‘libada.gpr’ is
provided to that effect and can be found in the directory containing the
GNAT library.  The location of this directory depends on the way the
GNAT environment has been installed and can be determined by means of
the command:

     $ gnatls -v

The last entry in the source search path usually contains the gnat
library (the ‘adainclude’ directory).  This project file contains its
own documentation and in particular the set of instructions needed to
rebuild a new library and to use it.

Note that rebuilding the GNAT Run-Time is only recommended for temporary
experiments or debugging, and is not supported.

compilation in Ada and describes the gnatprep preprocessor utility.

3.10.1 Modeling Conditional Compilation in Ada
----------------------------------------------

It is often necessary to arrange for a single source program to serve
multiple purposes, where it is compiled in different ways to achieve
these different goals.  Some examples of the need for this feature are

   * Adapting a program to a different hardware environment

   * Adapting a program to a different target architecture

   * Turning debugging features on and off

   * Arranging for a program to compile with different compilers

In C, or C++, the typical approach would be to use the preprocessor that
is defined as part of the language.  The Ada language does not contain
such a feature.  This is not an oversight, but rather a very deliberate
design decision, based on the experience that overuse of the
preprocessing features in C and C++ can result in programs that are
extremely difficult to maintain.  For example, if we have ten switches
that can be on or off, this means that there are a thousand separate
programs, any one of which might not even be syntactically correct, and
even if syntactically correct, the resulting program might not work
correctly.  Testing all combinations can quickly become impossible.

Nevertheless, the need to tailor programs certainly exists, and in this
section we will discuss how this can be achieved using Ada in general,
and GNAT in particular.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Use of Boolean Constants,  Next: Debugging - A Special Case,  Up: Modeling Conditional Compilation in Ada

3.10.1.1 Use of Boolean Constants
.................................

In the case where the difference is simply which code sequence is
executed, the cleanest solution is to use Boolean constants to control
which code is executed.

     FP_Initialize_Required : constant Boolean := True;
     ...
     if FP_Initialize_Required then
     ...
     end if;

Not only will the code inside the ‘if’ statement not be executed if the
constant Boolean is ‘False’, but it will also be completely deleted from
the program.  However, the code is only deleted after the ‘if’ statement
has been checked for syntactic and semantic correctness.  (In contrast,
with preprocessors the code is deleted before the compiler ever gets to
see it, so it is not checked until the switch is turned on.)

Typically the Boolean constants will be in a separate package, something
like:

     package Config is
        FP_Initialize_Required : constant Boolean := True;
        Reset_Available        : constant Boolean := False;
        ...
     end Config;

The ‘Config’ package exists in multiple forms for the various targets,
with an appropriate script selecting the version of ‘Config’ needed.
Then any other unit requiring conditional compilation can do a ‘with’ of
‘Config’ to make the constants visible.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Debugging - A Special Case,  Next: Conditionalizing Declarations,  Prev: Use of Boolean Constants,  Up: Modeling Conditional Compilation in Ada

3.10.1.2 Debugging - A Special Case
...................................

A common use of conditional code is to execute statements (for example
dynamic checks, or output of intermediate results) under control of a
debug switch, so that the debugging behavior can be turned on and off.
This can be done using a Boolean constant to control whether the code is
active:

     if Debugging then
        Put_Line ("got to the first stage!");
     end if;

or

     if Debugging and then Temperature > 999.0 then
        raise Temperature_Crazy;
     end if;

Since this is a common case, there are special features to deal with
this in a convenient manner.  For the case of tests, Ada 2005 has added
a pragma ‘Assert’ that can be used for such tests.  This pragma is
modeled on the ‘Assert’ pragma that has always been available in GNAT,
so this feature may be used with GNAT even if you are not using Ada 2005
features.  The use of pragma ‘Assert’ is described in the
‘GNAT_Reference_Manual’, but as an example, the last test could be
written:

     pragma Assert (Temperature <= 999.0, "Temperature Crazy");

or simply

     pragma Assert (Temperature <= 999.0);

In both cases, if assertions are active and the temperature is
excessive, the exception ‘Assert_Failure’ will be raised, with the given
string in the first case or a string indicating the location of the
pragma in the second case used as the exception message.

You can turn assertions on and off by using the ‘Assertion_Policy’
pragma.

This is an Ada 2005 pragma which is implemented in all modes by GNAT.
Alternatively, you can use the ‘-gnata’ switch to enable assertions from
the command line, which applies to all versions of Ada.

For the example above with the ‘Put_Line’, the GNAT-specific pragma
‘Debug’ can be used:

     pragma Debug (Put_Line ("got to the first stage!"));

If debug pragmas are enabled, the argument, which must be of the form of
a procedure call, is executed (in this case, ‘Put_Line’ will be called).
Only one call can be present, but of course a special debugging
procedure containing any code you like can be included in the program
and then called in a pragma ‘Debug’ argument as needed.

One advantage of pragma ‘Debug’ over the ‘if Debugging then’ construct
is that pragma ‘Debug’ can appear in declarative contexts, such as at
the very beginning of a procedure, before local declarations have been
elaborated.

Debug pragmas are enabled using either the ‘-gnata’ switch that also
controls assertions, or with a separate Debug_Policy pragma.

The latter pragma is new in the Ada 2005 versions of GNAT (but it can be
used in Ada 95 and Ada 83 programs as well), and is analogous to pragma
‘Assertion_Policy’ to control assertions.

‘Assertion_Policy’ and ‘Debug_Policy’ are configuration pragmas, and
thus they can appear in ‘gnat.adc’ if you are not using a project file,
or in the file designated to contain configuration pragmas in a project
file.  They then apply to all subsequent compilations.  In practice the
use of the ‘-gnata’ switch is often the most convenient method of
controlling the status of these pragmas.

Note that a pragma is not a statement, so in contexts where a statement
sequence is required, you can’t just write a pragma on its own.  You
have to add a ‘null’ statement.

     if ... then
        ... -- some statements
     else
        pragma Assert (Num_Cases < 10);
        null;
     end if;


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Conditionalizing Declarations,  Next: Use of Alternative Implementations,  Prev: Debugging - A Special Case,  Up: Modeling Conditional Compilation in Ada

3.10.1.3 Conditionalizing Declarations
......................................

In some cases it may be necessary to conditionalize declarations to meet
different requirements.  For example we might want a bit string whose
length is set to meet some hardware message requirement.

This may be possible using declare blocks controlled by conditional
constants:

     if Small_Machine then
        declare
           X : Bit_String (1 .. 10);
        begin
           ...
        end;
     else
        declare
           X : Large_Bit_String (1 .. 1000);
        begin
           ...
        end;
     end if;

Note that in this approach, both declarations are analyzed by the
compiler so this can only be used where both declarations are legal,
even though one of them will not be used.

Another approach is to define integer constants, e.g., ‘Bits_Per_Word’,
or Boolean constants, e.g., ‘Little_Endian’, and then write declarations
that are parameterized by these constants.  For example

     for Rec use
       Field1 at 0 range Boolean'Pos (Little_Endian) * 10 .. Bits_Per_Word;
     end record;

If ‘Bits_Per_Word’ is set to 32, this generates either

     for Rec use
       Field1 at 0 range 0 .. 32;
     end record;

for the big endian case, or

     for Rec use record
         Field1 at 0 range 10 .. 32;
     end record;

for the little endian case.  Since a powerful subset of Ada expression
notation is usable for creating static constants, clever use of this
feature can often solve quite difficult problems in conditionalizing
compilation (note incidentally that in Ada 95, the little endian
constant was introduced as ‘System.Default_Bit_Order’, so you do not
need to define this one yourself).


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Use of Alternative Implementations,  Next: Preprocessing,  Prev: Conditionalizing Declarations,  Up: Modeling Conditional Compilation in Ada

3.10.1.4 Use of Alternative Implementations
...........................................

In some cases, none of the approaches described above are adequate.
This can occur for example if the set of declarations required is
radically different for two different configurations.

In this situation, the official Ada way of dealing with conditionalizing
such code is to write separate units for the different cases.  As long
as this does not result in excessive duplication of code, this can be
done without creating maintenance problems.  The approach is to share
common code as far as possible, and then isolate the code and
declarations that are different.  Subunits are often a convenient method
for breaking out a piece of a unit that is to be conditionalized, with
separate files for different versions of the subunit for different
targets, where the build script selects the right one to give to the
compiler.

As an example, consider a situation where a new feature in Ada 2005
allows something to be done in a really nice way.  But your code must be
able to compile with an Ada 95 compiler.  Conceptually you want to say:

     if Ada_2005 then
        ... neat Ada 2005 code
     else
        ... not quite as neat Ada 95 code
     end if;

where ‘Ada_2005’ is a Boolean constant.

But this won’t work when ‘Ada_2005’ is set to ‘False’, since the ‘then’
clause will be illegal for an Ada 95 compiler.  (Recall that although
such unreachable code would eventually be deleted by the compiler, it
still needs to be legal.  If it uses features introduced in Ada 2005, it
will be illegal in Ada 95.)

So instead we write

     procedure Insert is separate;

Then we have two files for the subunit ‘Insert’, with the two sets of
code.  If the package containing this is called ‘File_Queries’, then we
might have two files

   * ‘file_queries-insert-2005.adb’

   * ‘file_queries-insert-95.adb’

and the build script renames the appropriate file to
‘file_queries-insert.adb’ and then carries out the compilation.

This can also be done with project files’ naming schemes.  For example:

     for body ("File_Queries.Insert") use "file_queries-insert-2005.ada";

Note also that with project files it is desirable to use a different
extension than ‘ads’ / ‘adb’ for alternative versions.  Otherwise a
naming conflict may arise through another commonly used feature: to
declare as part of the project a set of directories containing all the
sources obeying the default naming scheme.

The use of alternative units is certainly feasible in all situations,
and for example the Ada part of the GNAT run-time is conditionalized
based on the target architecture using this approach.  As a specific
example, consider the implementation of the AST feature in VMS. There is
one spec: ‘s-asthan.ads’ which is the same for all architectures, and
three bodies:

   * 
     ‘s-asthan.adb’

          used for all non-VMS operating systems

   * 
     ‘s-asthan-vms-alpha.adb’

          used for VMS on the Alpha

   * 
     ‘s-asthan-vms-ia64.adb’

          used for VMS on the ia64

The dummy version ‘s-asthan.adb’ simply raises exceptions noting that
this operating system feature is not available, and the two remaining
versions interface with the corresponding versions of VMS to provide
VMS-compatible AST handling.  The GNAT build script knows the
architecture and operating system, and automatically selects the right
version, renaming it if necessary to ‘s-asthan.adb’ before the run-time
build.

Another style for arranging alternative implementations is through Ada’s
access-to-subprogram facility.  In case some functionality is to be
conditionally included, you can declare an access-to-procedure variable
‘Ref’ that is initialized to designate a ‘do nothing’ procedure, and
then invoke ‘Ref.all’ when appropriate.  In some library package, set
‘Ref’ to ‘Proc'Access’ for some procedure ‘Proc’ that performs the
relevant processing.  The initialization only occurs if the library
package is included in the program.  The same idea can also be
implemented using tagged types and dispatching calls.

3.10.1.5 Preprocessing
......................

Although it is quite possible to conditionalize code without the use of
C-style preprocessing, as described earlier in this section, it is
nevertheless convenient in some cases to use the C approach.  Moreover,
older Ada compilers have often provided some preprocessing capability,
so legacy code may depend on this approach, even though it is not
standard.

To accommodate such use, GNAT provides a preprocessor (modeled to a
large extent on the various preprocessors that have been used with
legacy code on other compilers, to enable easier transition).

The preprocessor may be used in two separate modes.  It can be used
quite separately from the compiler, to generate a separate output source
file that is then fed to the compiler as a separate step.  This is the
‘gnatprep’ utility, whose use is fully described in *note Preprocessing
with gnatprep: 90.

The preprocessing language allows such constructs as

     #if DEBUG or else (PRIORITY > 4) then
        sequence of declarations
     #else
        completely different sequence of declarations
     #end if;

The values of the symbols ‘DEBUG’ and ‘PRIORITY’ can be defined either
on the command line or in a separate file.

The other way of running the preprocessor is even closer to the C style
and often more convenient.  In this approach the preprocessing is
integrated into the compilation process.  The compiler is given the
preprocessor input which includes ‘#if’ lines etc, and then the compiler
carries out the preprocessing internally and processes the resulting
output.  For more details on this approach, see *note Integrated
Preprocessing: 91.

3.10.2 Preprocessing with ‘gnatprep’
------------------------------------

This section discusses how to use GNAT’s ‘gnatprep’ utility for simple
preprocessing.  Although designed for use with GNAT, ‘gnatprep’ does not
depend on any special GNAT features.  For further discussion of
conditional compilation in general, see *note Conditional Compilation:

3.10.2.1 Preprocessing Symbols
..............................

Preprocessing symbols are defined in ‘definition files’ and referenced
in the sources to be preprocessed.  A preprocessing symbol is an
identifier, following normal Ada (case-insensitive) rules for its
syntax, with the restriction that all characters need to be in the ASCII
set (no accented letters).

3.10.2.2 Using ‘gnatprep’
.........................

To call ‘gnatprep’ use:

     $ gnatprep [ switches ] infile outfile [ deffile ]

where

   * 
     ‘switches’

          is an optional sequence of switches as described in the next
          section.

   * 
     ‘infile’

          is the full name of the input file, which is an Ada source
          file containing preprocessor directives.

   * 
     ‘outfile’

          is the full name of the output file, which is an Ada source in
          standard Ada form.  When used with GNAT, this file name will
          normally have an ‘ads’ or ‘adb’ suffix.

   * 
     ‘deffile’

          is the full name of a text file containing definitions of
          preprocessing symbols to be referenced by the preprocessor.
          This argument is optional, and can be replaced by the use of
          the ‘-D’ switch.

3.10.2.3 Switches for ‘gnatprep’
................................

‘--version’

     Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

‘--help’

     If ‘--version’ was not used, display usage and then exit
     disregarding all other options.

‘-b’

     Causes both preprocessor lines and the lines deleted by
     preprocessing to be replaced by blank lines in the output source
     file, preserving line numbers in the output file.

‘-c’

     Causes both preprocessor lines and the lines deleted by
     preprocessing to be retained in the output source as comments
     marked with the special string ‘"--! "’.  This option will result
     in line numbers being preserved in the output file.

‘-C’

     Causes comments to be scanned.  Normally comments are ignored by
     gnatprep.  If this option is specified, then comments are scanned
     and any $symbol substitutions performed as in program text.  This
     is particularly useful when structured comments are used (e.g., for
     programs written in a pre-2014 version of the SPARK Ada subset).
     Note that this switch is not available when doing integrated
     preprocessing (it would be useless in this context since comments
     are ignored by the compiler in any case).

‘-D`symbol'[=`value']’

     Defines a new preprocessing symbol with the specified value.  If no
     value is given on the command line, then symbol is considered to be
     ‘True’.  This switch can be used in place of a definition file.

‘-r’

     Causes a ‘Source_Reference’ pragma to be generated that references
     the original input file, so that error messages will use the file
     name of this original file.  The use of this switch implies that
     preprocessor lines are not to be removed from the file, so its use
     will force ‘-b’ mode if ‘-c’ has not been specified explicitly.

     Note that if the file to be preprocessed contains multiple units,
     then it will be necessary to ‘gnatchop’ the output file from
     ‘gnatprep’.  If a ‘Source_Reference’ pragma is present in the
     preprocessed file, it will be respected by ‘gnatchop -r’ so that
     the final chopped files will correctly refer to the original input
     source file for ‘gnatprep’.

‘-s’

     Causes a sorted list of symbol names and values to be listed on the
     standard output file.

‘-T’

     Use LF as line terminators when writing files.  By default the line
     terminator of the host (LF under unix, CR/LF under Windows) is
     used.

‘-u’

     Causes undefined symbols to be treated as having the value FALSE in
     the context of a preprocessor test.  In the absence of this option,
     an undefined symbol in a ‘#if’ or ‘#elsif’ test will be treated as
     an error.

‘-v’

     Verbose mode: generates more output about work done.

Note: if neither ‘-b’ nor ‘-c’ is present, then preprocessor lines and
deleted lines are completely removed from the output, unless -r is
specified, in which case -b is assumed.

3.10.2.4 Form of Definitions File
.................................

The definitions file contains lines of the form:

     symbol := value

where ‘symbol’ is a preprocessing symbol, and ‘value’ is one of the
following:

   * Empty, corresponding to a null substitution,

   * A string literal using normal Ada syntax, or

   * Any sequence of characters from the set {letters, digits, period,
     underline}.

Comment lines may also appear in the definitions file, starting with the
usual ‘--’, and comments may be added to the definitions lines.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Form of Input Text for gnatprep,  Prev: Form of Definitions File,  Up: Preprocessing with gnatprep

3.10.2.5 Form of Input Text for ‘gnatprep’
..........................................

The input text may contain preprocessor conditional inclusion lines, as
well as general symbol substitution sequences.

The preprocessor conditional inclusion commands have the form:

     #if <expression> [then]
        lines
     #elsif <expression> [then]
        lines
     #elsif <expression> [then]
        lines
     ...
     #else
        lines
     #end if;

In this example, <expression> is defined by the following grammar:

     <expression> ::=  <symbol>
     <expression> ::=  <symbol> = "<value>"
     <expression> ::=  <symbol> = <symbol>
     <expression> ::=  <symbol> = <integer>
     <expression> ::=  <symbol> > <integer>
     <expression> ::=  <symbol> >= <integer>
     <expression> ::=  <symbol> < <integer>
     <expression> ::=  <symbol> <= <integer>
     <expression> ::=  <symbol> 'Defined
     <expression> ::=  not <expression>
     <expression> ::=  <expression> and <expression>
     <expression> ::=  <expression> or <expression>
     <expression> ::=  <expression> and then <expression>
     <expression> ::=  <expression> or else <expression>
     <expression> ::=  ( <expression> )

Note the following restriction: it is not allowed to have “and” or “or”
following “not” in the same expression without parentheses.  For
example, this is not allowed:

     not X or Y

This can be expressed instead as one of the following forms:

     (not X) or Y
     not (X or Y)

For the first test (<expression> ::= <symbol>) the symbol must have
either the value true or false, that is to say the right-hand of the
symbol definition must be one of the (case-insensitive) literals ‘True’
or ‘False’.  If the value is true, then the corresponding lines are
included, and if the value is false, they are excluded.

When comparing a symbol to an integer, the integer is any non negative
literal integer as defined in the Ada Reference Manual, such as 3,
16#FF# or 2#11#.  The symbol value must also be a non negative integer.
Integer values in the range 0 ..  2**31-1 are supported.

The test (<expression> ::= <symbol>’Defined) is true only if the symbol
has been defined in the definition file or by a ‘-D’ switch on the
command line.  Otherwise, the test is false.

The equality tests are case insensitive, as are all the preprocessor
lines.

If the symbol referenced is not defined in the symbol definitions file,
then the effect depends on whether or not switch ‘-u’ is specified.  If
so, then the symbol is treated as if it had the value false and the test
fails.  If this switch is not specified, then it is an error to
reference an undefined symbol.  It is also an error to reference a
symbol that is defined with a value other than ‘True’ or ‘False’.

The use of the ‘not’ operator inverts the sense of this logical test.
The ‘not’ operator cannot be combined with the ‘or’ or ‘and’ operators,
without parentheses.  For example, “if not X or Y then” is not allowed,
but “if (not X) or Y then” and “if not (X or Y) then” are.

The ‘then’ keyword is optional as shown

The ‘#’ must be the first non-blank character on a line, but otherwise
the format is free form.  Spaces or tabs may appear between the ‘#’ and
the keyword.  The keywords and the symbols are case insensitive as in
normal Ada code.  Comments may be used on a preprocessor line, but other
than that, no other tokens may appear on a preprocessor line.  Any
number of ‘elsif’ clauses can be present, including none at all.  The
‘else’ is optional, as in Ada.

The ‘#’ marking the start of a preprocessor line must be the first
non-blank character on the line, i.e., it must be preceded only by
spaces or horizontal tabs.

Symbol substitution outside of preprocessor lines is obtained by using
the sequence:

     $symbol

anywhere within a source line, except in a comment or within a string
literal.  The identifier following the ‘$’ must match one of the symbols
defined in the symbol definition file, and the result is to substitute
the value of the symbol in place of ‘$symbol’ in the output file.

Note that although the substitution of strings within a string literal
is not possible, it is possible to have a symbol whose defined value is
a string literal.  So instead of setting XYZ to ‘hello’ and writing:

     Header : String := "$XYZ";

you should set XYZ to ‘"hello"’ and write:

     Header : String := $XYZ;

and then the substitution will occur as desired.

3.10.3 Integrated Preprocessing
-------------------------------

As noted above, a file to be preprocessed consists of Ada source code in
which preprocessing lines have been inserted.  However, instead of using
‘gnatprep’ to explicitly preprocess a file as a separate step before
compilation, you can carry out the preprocessing implicitly as part of
compilation.  Such ‘integrated preprocessing’, which is the common style
with C, is performed when either or both of the following switches are
passed to the compiler:

        * ‘-gnatep’, which specifies the ‘preprocessor data file’.  This
          file dictates how the source files will be preprocessed (e.g.,
          which symbol definition files apply to which sources).

        * ‘-gnateD’, which defines values for preprocessing symbols.

Integrated preprocessing applies only to Ada source files, it is not
available for configuration pragma files.

With integrated preprocessing, the output from the preprocessor is not,
by default, written to any external file.  Instead it is passed
internally to the compiler.  To preserve the result of preprocessing in
a file, either run ‘gnatprep’ in standalone mode or else supply the
‘-gnateG’ switch (described below) to the compiler.

When using project files:

        * the builder switch ‘-x’ should be used if any Ada source is
          compiled with ‘gnatep=’, so that the compiler finds the
          ‘preprocessor data file’.

        * the preprocessing data file and the symbol definition files
          should be located in the source directories of the project.

Note that the ‘gnatmake’ switch ‘-m’ will almost always trigger
recompilation for sources that are preprocessed, because ‘gnatmake’
cannot compute the checksum of the source after preprocessing.

The actual preprocessing function is described in detail in *note
Preprocessing with gnatprep: 90.  This section explains the switches
that relate to integrated preprocessing.

‘-gnatep=`preprocessor_data_file'’

     This switch specifies the file name (without directory information)
     of the preprocessor data file.  Either place this file in one of
     the source directories, or, when using project files, reference the
     project file’s directory via the ‘project_name'Project_Dir’ project
     attribute; e.g:

               project Prj is
                  package Compiler is
                     for Switches ("Ada") use
                       ("-gnatep=" & Prj'Project_Dir & "prep.def");
                  end Compiler;
               end Prj;

     A preprocessor data file is a text file that contains ‘preprocessor
     control lines’.  A preprocessor control line directs the
     preprocessing of either a particular source file, or, analogous to
     ‘others’ in Ada, all sources not specified elsewhere in the
     preprocessor data file.  A preprocessor control line can optionally
     identify a ‘definition file’ that assigns values to preprocessor
     symbols, as well as a list of switches that relate to
     preprocessing.  Empty lines and comments (using Ada syntax) are
     also permitted, with no semantic effect.

     Here’s an example of a preprocessor data file:

               "toto.adb"  "prep.def" -u
               --  Preprocess toto.adb, using definition file prep.def
               --  Undefined symbols are treated as False

               * -c -DVERSION=V101
               --  Preprocess all other sources without using a definition file
               --  Suppressed lined are commented
               --  Symbol VERSION has the value V101

               "tata.adb" "prep2.def" -s
               --  Preprocess tata.adb, using definition file prep2.def
               --  List all symbols with their values

     A preprocessor control line has the following syntax:

               <preprocessor_control_line> ::=
                  <preprocessor_input> [ <definition_file_name> ] { <switch> }

               <preprocessor_input> ::= <source_file_name> | '*'

               <definition_file_name> ::= <string_literal>

               <source_file_name> := <string_literal>

               <switch> := (See below for list)

     Thus each preprocessor control line starts with either a literal
     string or the character ‘*’:

        * A literal string is the file name (without directory
          information) of the source file that will be input to the
          preprocessor.

        * The character ‘*’ is a wild-card indicator; the additional
          parameters on the line indicate the preprocessing for all the
          sources that are not specified explicitly on other lines (the
          order of the lines is not significant).

     It is an error to have two lines with the same file name or two
     lines starting with the character ‘*’.

     After the file name or ‘*’, an optional literal string specifies
     the name of the definition file to be used for preprocessing (*note
     Form of Definitions File: 99.).  The definition files are found by
     the compiler in one of the source directories.  In some cases, when
     compiling a source in a directory other than the current directory,
     if the definition file is in the current directory, it may be
     necessary to add the current directory as a source directory
     through the ‘-I’ switch; otherwise the compiler would not find the
     definition file.

     Finally, switches similar to those of ‘gnatprep’ may optionally
     appear:

     ‘-b’

          Causes both preprocessor lines and the lines deleted by
          preprocessing to be replaced by blank lines, preserving the
          line number.  This switch is always implied; however, if
          specified after ‘-c’ it cancels the effect of ‘-c’.

     ‘-c’

          Causes both preprocessor lines and the lines deleted by
          preprocessing to be retained as comments marked with the
          special string ‘‘–!’’.

     ‘-D`symbol'=`new_value'’

          Define or redefine ‘symbol’ to have ‘new_value’ as its value.
          The permitted form for ‘symbol’ is either an Ada identifier,
          or any Ada reserved word aside from ‘if’, ‘else’, ‘elsif’,
          ‘end’, ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘then’.  The permitted form for
          ‘new_value’ is a literal string, an Ada identifier or any Ada
          reserved word.  A symbol declared with this switch replaces a
          symbol with the same name defined in a definition file.

     ‘-s’

          Causes a sorted list of symbol names and values to be listed
          on the standard output file.

     ‘-u’

          Causes undefined symbols to be treated as having the value
          ‘FALSE’ in the context of a preprocessor test.  In the absence
          of this option, an undefined symbol in a ‘#if’ or ‘#elsif’
          test will be treated as an error.

‘-gnateD`symbol'[=`new_value']’

     Define or redefine ‘symbol’ to have ‘new_value’ as its value.  If
     no value is supplied, then the value of ‘symbol’ is ‘True’.  The
     form of ‘symbol’ is an identifier, following normal Ada
     (case-insensitive) rules for its syntax, and ‘new_value’ is either
     an arbitrary string between double quotes or any sequence
     (including an empty sequence) of characters from the set (letters,
     digits, period, underline).  Ada reserved words may be used as
     symbols, with the exceptions of ‘if’, ‘else’, ‘elsif’, ‘end’,
     ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘then’.

     Examples:

               -gnateDToto=Tata
               -gnateDFoo
               -gnateDFoo=\"Foo-Bar\"

     A symbol declared with this switch on the command line replaces a
     symbol with the same name either in a definition file or specified
     with a switch ‘-D’ in the preprocessor data file.

     This switch is similar to switch ‘-D’ of ‘gnatprep’.

‘-gnateG’

     When integrated preprocessing is performed on source file
     ‘filename.extension’, create or overwrite ‘filename.extension.prep’
     to contain the result of the preprocessing.  For example if the
     source file is ‘foo.adb’ then the output file will be
     ‘foo.adb.prep’.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Interfacing to C,  Next: Calling Conventions,  Up: Mixed Language Programming

3.11.1 Interfacing to C
-----------------------

Interfacing Ada with a foreign language such as C involves using
compiler directives to import and/or export entity definitions in each
language – using ‘extern’ statements in C, for instance, and the
‘Import’, ‘Export’, and ‘Convention’ pragmas in Ada.  A full treatment
of these topics is provided in Appendix B, section 1 of the Ada
Reference Manual.

There are two ways to build a program using GNAT that contains some Ada
sources and some foreign language sources, depending on whether or not
the main subprogram is written in Ada.  Here is a source example with
the main subprogram in Ada:

     /* file1.c */
     #include <stdio.h>

     void print_num (int num)
     {
       printf ("num is %d.\\n", num);
       return;
     }

     /* file2.c */

     /* num_from_Ada is declared in my_main.adb */
     extern int num_from_Ada;

     int get_num (void)
     {
       return num_from_Ada;
     }

     --  my_main.adb
     procedure My_Main is

        --  Declare then export an Integer entity called num_from_Ada
        My_Num : Integer := 10;
        pragma Export (C, My_Num, "num_from_Ada");

        --  Declare an Ada function spec for Get_Num, then use
        --  C function get_num for the implementation.
        function Get_Num return Integer;
        pragma Import (C, Get_Num, "get_num");

        --  Declare an Ada procedure spec for Print_Num, then use
        --  C function print_num for the implementation.
        procedure Print_Num (Num : Integer);
        pragma Import (C, Print_Num, "print_num");

     begin
        Print_Num (Get_Num);
     end My_Main;

To build this example:

   * First compile the foreign language files to generate object files:

          $ gcc -c file1.c
          $ gcc -c file2.c

   * Then, compile the Ada units to produce a set of object files and
     ALI files:

          $ gnatmake -c my_main.adb

   * Run the Ada binder on the Ada main program:

          $ gnatbind my_main.ali

   * Link the Ada main program, the Ada objects and the other language
     objects:

          $ gnatlink my_main.ali file1.o file2.o

The last three steps can be grouped in a single command:

     $ gnatmake my_main.adb -largs file1.o file2.o

If the main program is in a language other than Ada, then you may have
more than one entry point into the Ada subsystem.  You must use a
special binder option to generate callable routines that initialize and
finalize the Ada units (*note Binding with Non-Ada Main Programs: 7e.).
Calls to the initialization and finalization routines must be inserted
in the main program, or some other appropriate point in the code.  The
call to initialize the Ada units must occur before the first Ada
subprogram is called, and the call to finalize the Ada units must occur
after the last Ada subprogram returns.  The binder will place the
initialization and finalization subprograms into the ‘b~xxx.adb’ file
where they can be accessed by your C sources.  To illustrate, we have
the following example:

     /* main.c */
     extern void adainit (void);
     extern void adafinal (void);
     extern int add (int, int);
     extern int sub (int, int);

     int main (int argc, char *argv[])
     {
        int a = 21, b = 7;

        adainit();

        /* Should print "21 + 7 = 28" */
        printf ("%d + %d = %d\\n", a, b, add (a, b));

        /* Should print "21 - 7 = 14" */
        printf ("%d - %d = %d\\n", a, b, sub (a, b));

        adafinal();
     }

     --  unit1.ads
     package Unit1 is
        function Add (A, B : Integer) return Integer;
        pragma Export (C, Add, "add");
     end Unit1;

     --  unit1.adb
     package body Unit1 is
        function Add (A, B : Integer) return Integer is
        begin
           return A + B;
        end Add;
     end Unit1;

     --  unit2.ads
     package Unit2 is
        function Sub (A, B : Integer) return Integer;
        pragma Export (C, Sub, "sub");
     end Unit2;

     --  unit2.adb
     package body Unit2 is
        function Sub (A, B : Integer) return Integer is
        begin
           return A - B;
        end Sub;
     end Unit2;

The build procedure for this application is similar to the last
example’s:

   * First, compile the foreign language files to generate object files:

          $ gcc -c main.c

   * Next, compile the Ada units to produce a set of object files and
     ALI files:

          $ gnatmake -c unit1.adb
          $ gnatmake -c unit2.adb

   * Run the Ada binder on every generated ALI file.  Make sure to use
     the ‘-n’ option to specify a foreign main program:

          $ gnatbind -n unit1.ali unit2.ali

   * Link the Ada main program, the Ada objects and the foreign language
     objects.  You need only list the last ALI file here:

          $ gnatlink unit2.ali main.o -o exec_file

     This procedure yields a binary executable called ‘exec_file’.

Depending on the circumstances (for example when your non-Ada main
object does not provide symbol ‘main’), you may also need to instruct
the GNAT linker not to include the standard startup objects by passing
the ‘-nostartfiles’ switch to ‘gnatlink’.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Calling Conventions,  Next: Building Mixed Ada and C++ Programs,  Prev: Interfacing to C,  Up: Mixed Language Programming

3.11.2 Calling Conventions
--------------------------

GNAT follows standard calling sequence conventions and will thus
interface to any other language that also follows these conventions.
The following Convention identifiers are recognized by GNAT:

‘Ada’

     This indicates that the standard Ada calling sequence will be used
     and all Ada data items may be passed without any limitations in the
     case where GNAT is used to generate both the caller and callee.  It
     is also possible to mix GNAT generated code and code generated by
     another Ada compiler.  In this case, the data types should be
     restricted to simple cases, including primitive types.  Whether
     complex data types can be passed depends on the situation.
     Probably it is safe to pass simple arrays, such as arrays of
     integers or floats.  Records may or may not work, depending on
     whether both compilers lay them out identically.  Complex
     structures involving variant records, access parameters, tasks, or
     protected types, are unlikely to be able to be passed.

     Note that in the case of GNAT running on a platform that supports
     HP Ada 83, a higher degree of compatibility can be guaranteed, and
     in particular records are laid out in an identical manner in the
     two compilers.  Note also that if output from two different
     compilers is mixed, the program is responsible for dealing with
     elaboration issues.  Probably the safest approach is to write the
     main program in the version of Ada other than GNAT, so that it
     takes care of its own elaboration requirements, and then call the
     GNAT-generated adainit procedure to ensure elaboration of the GNAT
     components.  Consult the documentation of the other Ada compiler
     for further details on elaboration.

     However, it is not possible to mix the tasking run time of GNAT and
     HP Ada 83, all the tasking operations must either be entirely
     within GNAT compiled sections of the program, or entirely within HP
     Ada 83 compiled sections of the program.

‘Assembler’

     Specifies assembler as the convention.  In practice this has the
     same effect as convention Ada (but is not equivalent in the sense
     of being considered the same convention).

‘Asm’

     Equivalent to Assembler.

‘COBOL’

     Data will be passed according to the conventions described in
     section B.4 of the Ada Reference Manual.

‘C’

     Data will be passed according to the conventions described in
     section B.3 of the Ada Reference Manual.

     A note on interfacing to a C ‘varargs’ function:

          In C, ‘varargs’ allows a function to take a variable number of
          arguments.  There is no direct equivalent in this to Ada.  One
          approach that can be used is to create a C wrapper for each
          different profile and then interface to this C wrapper.  For
          example, to print an ‘int’ value using ‘printf’, create a C
          function ‘printfi’ that takes two arguments, a pointer to a
          string and an int, and calls ‘printf’.  Then in the Ada
          program, use pragma ‘Import’ to interface to ‘printfi’.

          It may work on some platforms to directly interface to a
          ‘varargs’ function by providing a specific Ada profile for a
          particular call.  However, this does not work on all
          platforms, since there is no guarantee that the calling
          sequence for a two argument normal C function is the same as
          for calling a ‘varargs’ C function with the same two
          arguments.

‘Default’

     Equivalent to C.

‘External’

     Equivalent to C.

‘C_Plus_Plus’ (or ‘CPP’)

     This stands for C++.  For most purposes this is identical to C. See
     the separate description of the specialized GNAT pragmas relating
     to C++ interfacing for further details.

‘Fortran’

     Data will be passed according to the conventions described in
     section B.5 of the Ada Reference Manual.

‘Intrinsic’

     This applies to an intrinsic operation, as defined in the Ada
     Reference Manual.  If a pragma Import (Intrinsic) applies to a
     subprogram, this means that the body of the subprogram is provided
     by the compiler itself, usually by means of an efficient code
     sequence, and that the user does not supply an explicit body for
     it.  In an application program, the pragma may be applied to the
     following sets of names:

        * Rotate_Left, Rotate_Right, Shift_Left, Shift_Right,
          Shift_Right_Arithmetic.  The corresponding subprogram
          declaration must have two formal parameters.  The first one
          must be a signed integer type or a modular type with a binary
          modulus, and the second parameter must be of type Natural.
          The return type must be the same as the type of the first
          argument.  The size of this type can only be 8, 16, 32, or 64.

        * Binary arithmetic operators: ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’.  The
          corresponding operator declaration must have parameters and
          result type that have the same root numeric type (for example,
          all three are long_float types).  This simplifies the
          definition of operations that use type checking to perform
          dimensional checks:

               type Distance is new Long_Float;
               type Time     is new Long_Float;
               type Velocity is new Long_Float;
               function "/" (D : Distance; T : Time)
                 return Velocity;
               pragma Import (Intrinsic, "/");

          This common idiom is often programmed with a generic
          definition and an explicit body.  The pragma makes it simpler
          to introduce such declarations.  It incurs no overhead in
          compilation time or code size, because it is implemented as a
          single machine instruction.

        * General subprogram entities.  This is used to bind an Ada
          subprogram declaration to a compiler builtin by name with
          back-ends where such interfaces are available.  A typical
          example is the set of ‘__builtin’ functions exposed by the GCC
          back-end, as in the following example:

               function builtin_sqrt (F : Float) return Float;
               pragma Import (Intrinsic, builtin_sqrt, "__builtin_sqrtf");

          Most of the GCC builtins are accessible this way, and as for
          other import conventions (e.g.  C), it is the user’s
          responsibility to ensure that the Ada subprogram profile
          matches the underlying builtin expectations.

‘Stdcall’

     This is relevant only to Windows implementations of GNAT, and
     specifies that the ‘Stdcall’ calling sequence will be used, as
     defined by the NT API. Nevertheless, to ease building
     cross-platform bindings this convention will be handled as a ‘C’
     calling convention on non-Windows platforms.

‘DLL’

     This is equivalent to ‘Stdcall’.

‘Win32’

     This is equivalent to ‘Stdcall’.

‘Stubbed’

     This is a special convention that indicates that the compiler
     should provide a stub body that raises ‘Program_Error’.

GNAT additionally provides a useful pragma ‘Convention_Identifier’ that
can be used to parameterize conventions and allow additional synonyms to
be specified.  For example if you have legacy code in which the
convention identifier Fortran77 was used for Fortran, you can use the
configuration pragma:

     pragma Convention_Identifier (Fortran77, Fortran);

And from now on the identifier Fortran77 may be used as a convention
identifier (for example in an ‘Import’ pragma) with the same meaning as
Fortran.

3.11.3.1 Interfacing to C++
...........................

GNAT supports interfacing with the G++ compiler (or any C++ compiler
generating code that is compatible with the G++ Application Binary
Interface —see ‘http://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html’).

Interfacing can be done at 3 levels: simple data, subprograms, and
classes.  In the first two cases, GNAT offers a specific ‘Convention
C_Plus_Plus’ (or ‘CPP’) that behaves exactly like ‘Convention C’.
Usually, C++ mangles the names of subprograms.  To generate proper
mangled names automatically, see *note Generating Ada Bindings for C and
C++ headers: a7.).  This problem can also be addressed manually in two
ways:

   * by modifying the C++ code in order to force a C convention using
     the ‘extern "C"’ syntax.

   * by figuring out the mangled name (using e.g.  ‘nm’) and using it as
     the Link_Name argument of the pragma import.

Interfacing at the class level can be achieved by using the GNAT
specific pragmas such as ‘CPP_Constructor’.  See the
‘GNAT_Reference_Manual’ for additional information.

3.11.3.2 Linking a Mixed C++ & Ada Program
..........................................

Usually the linker of the C++ development system must be used to link
mixed applications because most C++ systems will resolve elaboration
issues (such as calling constructors on global class instances)
transparently during the link phase.  GNAT has been adapted to ease the
use of a foreign linker for the last phase.  Three cases can be
considered:

   * Using GNAT and G++ (GNU C++ compiler) from the same GCC
     installation: The C++ linker can simply be called by using the C++
     specific driver called ‘g++’.

     Note that if the C++ code uses inline functions, you will need to
     compile your C++ code with the ‘-fkeep-inline-functions’ switch in
     order to provide an existing function implementation that the Ada
     code can link with.

          $ g++ -c -fkeep-inline-functions file1.C
          $ g++ -c -fkeep-inline-functions file2.C
          $ gnatmake ada_unit -largs file1.o file2.o --LINK=g++

   * Using GNAT and G++ from two different GCC installations: If both
     compilers are on the ‘PATH’, the previous method may be used.  It
     is important to note that environment variables such as
     ‘C_INCLUDE_PATH’, ‘GCC_EXEC_PREFIX’, ‘BINUTILS_ROOT’, and
     ‘GCC_ROOT’ will affect both compilers at the same time and may make
     one of the two compilers operate improperly if set during
     invocation of the wrong compiler.  It is also very important that
     the linker uses the proper ‘libgcc.a’ GCC library – that is, the
     one from the C++ compiler installation.  The implicit link command
     as suggested in the ‘gnatmake’ command from the former example can
     be replaced by an explicit link command with the full-verbosity
     option in order to verify which library is used:

          $ gnatbind ada_unit
          $ gnatlink -v -v ada_unit file1.o file2.o --LINK=c++

     If there is a problem due to interfering environment variables, it
     can be worked around by using an intermediate script.  The
     following example shows the proper script to use when GNAT has not
     been installed at its default location and g++ has been installed
     at its default location:

          $ cat ./my_script
          #!/bin/sh
          unset BINUTILS_ROOT
          unset GCC_ROOT
          c++ $*
          $ gnatlink -v -v ada_unit file1.o file2.o --LINK=./my_script

   * Using a non-GNU C++ compiler: The commands previously described can
     be used to insure that the C++ linker is used.  Nonetheless, you
     need to add a few more parameters to the link command line,
     depending on the exception mechanism used.

     If the ‘setjmp’ / ‘longjmp’ exception mechanism is used, only the
     paths to the ‘libgcc’ libraries are required:

          $ cat ./my_script
          #!/bin/sh
          CC $* gcc -print-file-name=libgcc.a gcc -print-file-name=libgcc_eh.a
          $ gnatlink ada_unit file1.o file2.o --LINK=./my_script

     where CC is the name of the non-GNU C++ compiler.

     If the “zero cost” exception mechanism is used, and the platform
     supports automatic registration of exception tables (e.g.,
     Solaris), paths to more objects are required:

          $ cat ./my_script
          #!/bin/sh
          CC gcc -print-file-name=crtbegin.o $* \\
          gcc -print-file-name=libgcc.a gcc -print-file-name=libgcc_eh.a \\
          gcc -print-file-name=crtend.o
          $ gnatlink ada_unit file1.o file2.o --LINK=./my_script

     If the “zero cost exception” mechanism is used, and the platform
     doesn’t support automatic registration of exception tables (e.g.,
     HP-UX or AIX), the simple approach described above will not work
     and a pre-linking phase using GNAT will be necessary.

Another alternative is to use the ‘gprbuild’ multi-language builder
which has a large knowledge base and knows how to link Ada and C++ code
together automatically in most cases.

3.11.3.3 A Simple Example
.........................

The following example, provided as part of the GNAT examples, shows how
to achieve procedural interfacing between Ada and C++ in both
directions.  The C++ class A has two methods.  The first method is
exported to Ada by the means of an extern C wrapper function.  The
second method calls an Ada subprogram.  On the Ada side, the C++ calls
are modelled by a limited record with a layout comparable to the C++
class.  The Ada subprogram, in turn, calls the C++ method.  So, starting
from the C++ main program, the process passes back and forth between the
two languages.

Here are the compilation commands:

     $ gnatmake -c simple_cpp_interface
     $ g++ -c cpp_main.C
     $ g++ -c ex7.C
     $ gnatbind -n simple_cpp_interface
     $ gnatlink simple_cpp_interface -o cpp_main --LINK=g++ -lstdc++ ex7.o cpp_main.o

Here are the corresponding sources:

     //cpp_main.C

     #include "ex7.h"

     extern "C" {
       void adainit (void);
       void adafinal (void);
       void method1 (A *t);

3.11.3.4 Interfacing with C++ constructors
..........................................

In order to interface with C++ constructors GNAT provides the ‘pragma
CPP_Constructor’ (see the ‘GNAT_Reference_Manual’ for additional
information).  In this section we present some common uses of C++
constructors in mixed-languages programs in GNAT.

Let us assume that we need to interface with the following C++ class:

     class Root {
     public:
       int  a_value;
       int  b_value;
       virtual int Get_Value ();
       Root();              // Default constructor
       Root(int v);         // 1st non-default constructor
       Root(int v, int w);  // 2nd non-default constructor
     };

For this purpose we can write the following package spec (further
information on how to build this spec is available in *note Interfacing
with C++ at the Class Level: ae. and *note Generating Ada Bindings for C
and C++ headers: a7.).

     with Interfaces.C; use Interfaces.C;
     package Pkg_Root is
       type Root is tagged limited record
          A_Value : int;
          B_Value : int;
       end record;
       pragma Import (CPP, Root);

       function Get_Value (Obj : Root) return int;
       pragma Import (CPP, Get_Value);

       function Constructor return Root;
       pragma Cpp_Constructor (Constructor, "_ZN4RootC1Ev");

       function Constructor (v : Integer) return Root;
       pragma Cpp_Constructor (Constructor, "_ZN4RootC1Ei");

       function Constructor (v, w : Integer) return Root;
       pragma Cpp_Constructor (Constructor, "_ZN4RootC1Eii");
     end Pkg_Root;

On the Ada side the constructor is represented by a function (whose name
is arbitrary) that returns the classwide type corresponding to the
imported C++ class.  Although the constructor is described as a
function, it is typically a procedure with an extra implicit argument
(the object being initialized) at the implementation level.  GNAT issues
the appropriate call, whatever it is, to get the object properly
initialized.

Constructors can only appear in the following contexts:

   * On the right side of an initialization of an object of type ‘T’.

   * On the right side of an initialization of a record component of
     type ‘T’.

   * In an Ada 2005 limited aggregate.

   * In an Ada 2005 nested limited aggregate.

   * In an Ada 2005 limited aggregate that initializes an object built
     in place by an extended return statement.

In a declaration of an object whose type is a class imported from C++,
either the default C++ constructor is implicitly called by GNAT, or else
the required C++ constructor must be explicitly called in the expression
that initializes the object.  For example:

     Obj1 : Root;
     Obj2 : Root := Constructor;
     Obj3 : Root := Constructor (v => 10);
     Obj4 : Root := Constructor (30, 40);

The first two declarations are equivalent: in both cases the default C++
constructor is invoked (in the former case the call to the constructor
is implicit, and in the latter case the call is explicit in the object
declaration).  ‘Obj3’ is initialized by the C++ non-default constructor
that takes an integer argument, and ‘Obj4’ is initialized by the
non-default C++ constructor that takes two integers.

Let us derive the imported C++ class in the Ada side.  For example:

     type DT is new Root with record
        C_Value : Natural := 2009;
     end record;

In this case the components DT inherited from the C++ side must be
initialized by a C++ constructor, and the additional Ada components of
type DT are initialized by GNAT. The initialization of such an object is
done either by default, or by means of a function returning an aggregate
of type DT, or by means of an extension aggregate.

     Obj5 : DT;
     Obj6 : DT := Function_Returning_DT (50);
     Obj7 : DT := (Constructor (30,40) with C_Value => 50);

The declaration of ‘Obj5’ invokes the default constructors: the C++
default constructor of the parent type takes care of the initialization
of the components inherited from Root, and GNAT takes care of the
default initialization of the additional Ada components of type DT (that
is, ‘C_Value’ is initialized to value 2009).  The order of invocation of
the constructors is consistent with the order of elaboration required by
Ada and C++.  That is, the constructor of the parent type is always
called before the constructor of the derived type.

Let us now consider a record that has components whose type is imported
from C++.  For example:

     type Rec1 is limited record
        Data1 : Root := Constructor (10);
        Value : Natural := 1000;
     end record;

     type Rec2 (D : Integer := 20) is limited record
        Rec   : Rec1;
        Data2 : Root := Constructor (D, 30);
     end record;

The initialization of an object of type ‘Rec2’ will call the non-default
C++ constructors specified for the imported components.  For example:

     Obj8 : Rec2 (40);

Using Ada 2005 we can use limited aggregates to initialize an object
invoking C++ constructors that differ from those specified in the type
declarations.  For example:

     Obj9 : Rec2 := (Rec => (Data1 => Constructor (15, 16),
                             others => <>),
                     others => <>);

The above declaration uses an Ada 2005 limited aggregate to initialize
‘Obj9’, and the C++ constructor that has two integer arguments is
invoked to initialize the ‘Data1’ component instead of the constructor
specified in the declaration of type ‘Rec1’.  In Ada 2005 the box in the
aggregate indicates that unspecified components are initialized using
the expression (if any) available in the component declaration.  That
is, in this case discriminant ‘D’ is initialized to value ‘20’, ‘Value’
is initialized to value 1000, and the non-default C++ constructor that
handles two integers takes care of initializing component ‘Data2’ with
values ‘20,30’.

In Ada 2005 we can use the extended return statement to build the Ada
equivalent to C++ non-default constructors.  For example:

     function Constructor (V : Integer) return Rec2 is
     begin
        return Obj : Rec2 := (Rec => (Data1  => Constructor (V, 20),
                                      others => <>),
                              others => <>) do
           --  Further actions required for construction of
           --  objects of type Rec2
           ...
        end record;
     end Constructor;

In this example the extended return statement construct is used to build
in place the returned object whose components are initialized by means
of a limited aggregate.  Any further action associated with the
constructor can be placed inside the construct.

3.11.3.5 Interfacing with C++ at the Class Level
................................................

In this section we demonstrate the GNAT features for interfacing with
C++ by means of an example making use of Ada 2005 abstract interface
types.  This example consists of a classification of animals; classes
have been used to model our main classification of animals, and
interfaces provide support for the management of secondary
classifications.  We first demonstrate a case in which the types and
constructors are defined on the C++ side and imported from the Ada side,
and latter the reverse case.

The root of our derivation will be the ‘Animal’ class, with a single
private attribute (the ‘Age’ of the animal), a constructor, and two
public primitives to set and get the value of this attribute.

     class Animal {
      public:
        virtual void Set_Age (int New_Age);
        virtual int Age ();
        Animal() {Age_Count = 0;};
      private:
        int Age_Count;
     };

Abstract interface types are defined in C++ by means of classes with
pure virtual functions and no data members.  In our example we will use
two interfaces that provide support for the common management of
‘Carnivore’ and ‘Domestic’ animals:

     class Carnivore {
     public:
        virtual int Number_Of_Teeth () = 0;
     };

     class Domestic {
     public:
        virtual void Set_Owner (char* Name) = 0;
     };

Using these declarations, we can now say that a ‘Dog’ is an animal that
is both Carnivore and Domestic, that is:

     class Dog : Animal, Carnivore, Domestic {
      public:
        virtual int  Number_Of_Teeth ();
        virtual void Set_Owner (char* Name);

        Dog(); // Constructor
      private:
        int  Tooth_Count;
        char *Owner;
     };

In the following examples we will assume that the previous declarations
are located in a file named ‘animals.h’.  The following package
demonstrates how to import these C++ declarations from the Ada side:

     with Interfaces.C.Strings; use Interfaces.C.Strings;
     package Animals is
       type Carnivore is limited interface;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Carnivore);
       function Number_Of_Teeth (X : Carnivore)
          return Natural is abstract;

       type Domestic is limited interface;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Domestic);
       procedure Set_Owner
         (X    : in out Domestic;
          Name : Chars_Ptr) is abstract;

       type Animal is tagged limited record
         Age : Natural;
       end record;
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Animal);

       procedure Set_Age (X : in out Animal; Age : Integer);
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Set_Age);

       function Age (X : Animal) return Integer;
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Age);

       function New_Animal return Animal;
       pragma CPP_Constructor (New_Animal);
       pragma Import (CPP, New_Animal, "_ZN6AnimalC1Ev");

       type Dog is new Animal and Carnivore and Domestic with record
         Tooth_Count : Natural;
         Owner       : Chars_Ptr;
       end record;
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Dog);

       function Number_Of_Teeth (A : Dog) return Natural;
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Number_Of_Teeth);

       procedure Set_Owner (A : in out Dog; Name : Chars_Ptr);
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Set_Owner);

       function New_Dog return Dog;
       pragma CPP_Constructor (New_Dog);
       pragma Import (CPP, New_Dog, "_ZN3DogC2Ev");
     end Animals;

Thanks to the compatibility between GNAT run-time structures and the C++
ABI, interfacing with these C++ classes is easy.  The only requirement
is that all the primitives and components must be declared exactly in
the same order in the two languages.

Regarding the abstract interfaces, we must indicate to the GNAT compiler
by means of a ‘pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus)’, the convention used to
pass the arguments to the called primitives will be the same as for C++.
For the imported classes we use ‘pragma Import’ with convention
‘C_Plus_Plus’ to indicate that they have been defined on the C++ side;
this is required because the dispatch table associated with these tagged
types will be built in the C++ side and therefore will not contain the
predefined Ada primitives which Ada would otherwise expect.

As the reader can see there is no need to indicate the C++ mangled names
associated with each subprogram because it is assumed that all the calls
to these primitives will be dispatching calls.  The only exception is
the constructor, which must be registered with the compiler by means of
‘pragma CPP_Constructor’ and needs to provide its associated C++ mangled
name because the Ada compiler generates direct calls to it.

With the above packages we can now declare objects of type Dog on the
Ada side and dispatch calls to the corresponding subprograms on the C++
side.  We can also extend the tagged type Dog with further fields and
primitives, and override some of its C++ primitives on the Ada side.
For example, here we have a type derivation defined on the Ada side that
inherits all the dispatching primitives of the ancestor from the C++
side.

     with Animals; use Animals;
     package Vaccinated_Animals is
       type Vaccinated_Dog is new Dog with null record;
       function Vaccination_Expired (A : Vaccinated_Dog) return Boolean;
     end Vaccinated_Animals;

It is important to note that, because of the ABI compatibility, the
programmer does not need to add any further information to indicate
either the object layout or the dispatch table entry associated with
each dispatching operation.

Now let us define all the types and constructors on the Ada side and
export them to C++, using the same hierarchy of our previous example:

     with Interfaces.C.Strings;
     use Interfaces.C.Strings;
     package Animals is
       type Carnivore is limited interface;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Carnivore);
       function Number_Of_Teeth (X : Carnivore)
          return Natural is abstract;

       type Domestic is limited interface;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Domestic);
       procedure Set_Owner
         (X    : in out Domestic;
          Name : Chars_Ptr) is abstract;

       type Animal is tagged record
         Age : Natural;
       end record;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Animal);

       procedure Set_Age (X : in out Animal; Age : Integer);
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, Set_Age);

       function Age (X : Animal) return Integer;
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, Age);

       function New_Animal return Animal'Class;
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, New_Animal);

       type Dog is new Animal and Carnivore and Domestic with record
         Tooth_Count : Natural;
         Owner       : String (1 .. 30);
       end record;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Dog);

       function Number_Of_Teeth (A : Dog) return Natural;
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, Number_Of_Teeth);

       procedure Set_Owner (A : in out Dog; Name : Chars_Ptr);
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, Set_Owner);

       function New_Dog return Dog'Class;
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, New_Dog);
     end Animals;

Compared with our previous example the only differences are the use of
‘pragma Convention’ (instead of ‘pragma Import’), and the use of ‘pragma
Export’ to indicate to the GNAT compiler that the primitives will be
available to C++.  Thanks to the ABI compatibility, on the C++ side
there is nothing else to be done; as explained above, the only
requirement is that all the primitives and components are declared in
exactly the same order.

For completeness, let us see a brief C++ main program that uses the
declarations available in ‘animals.h’ (presented in our first example)
to import and use the declarations from the Ada side, properly
initializing and finalizing the Ada run-time system along the way:

     #include "animals.h"
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     void Check_Carnivore (Carnivore *obj) {...}
     void Check_Domestic (Domestic *obj)   {...}
     void Check_Animal (Animal *obj)       {...}
     void Check_Dog (Dog *obj)             {...}

     extern "C" {
       void adainit (void);
       void adafinal (void);
       Dog* new_dog ();
     }

     void test ()
     {
       Dog *obj = new_dog();  // Ada constructor
       Check_Carnivore (obj); // Check secondary DT
       Check_Domestic (obj);  // Check secondary DT
       Check_Animal (obj);    // Check primary DT
       Check_Dog (obj);       // Check primary DT
     }

     int main ()
     {
       adainit ();  test();  adafinal ();
       return 0;
     }

3.11.4 Partition-Wide Settings
------------------------------

When building a mixed-language application it is important to be aware
that Ada enforces some partition-wide settings that may implicitly
impact the behavior of the other languages.

This is the case of certain signals that are reserved to the
implementation to implement proper Ada semantics (such as the behavior
of ‘abort’ statements).

It means that the Ada part of the application may override signal
handlers that were previously installed by either the system or by other
user code.

If your application requires that either system or user signals be
preserved then you need to instruct the Ada part not to install its own
signal handler.  This is done using ‘pragma Interrupt_State’ that
provides a general mechanism for overriding such uses of interrupts.

The set of interrupts for which the Ada run-time library sets a specific
signal handler is the following:

   * Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGSEGV

   * Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGBUS

   * Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGFPE

   * Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGILL

   * Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGABRT

The run-time library can be instructed not to install its signal handler
for a particular signal by using the configuration pragma
‘Interrupt_State’ in the Ada code.  For example:

     pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGSEGV, System);
     pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGBUS,  System);
     pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGFPE,  System);
     pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGILL,  System);
     pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGABRT, System);

Obviously, if the Ada run-time system cannot set these handlers it comes
with the drawback of not fully preserving Ada semantics.  ‘SIGSEGV’,
‘SIGBUS’, ‘SIGFPE’ and ‘SIGILL’ are used to raise corresponding Ada
exceptions in the application, while ‘SIGABRT’ is used to asynchronously
abort an action or a task.

3.11.5 Generating Ada Bindings for C and C++ headers
----------------------------------------------------

GNAT includes a binding generator for C and C++ headers which is
intended to do 95% of the tedious work of generating Ada specs from C or
C++ header files.

Note that this capability is not intended to generate 100% correct Ada
specs, and will is some cases require manual adjustments, although it
can often be used out of the box in practice.

Some of the known limitations include:

   * only very simple character constant macros are translated into Ada
     constants.  Function macros (macros with arguments) are partially
     translated as comments, to be completed manually if needed.

   * some extensions (e.g.  vector types) are not supported

   * pointers to pointers are mapped to System.Address

   * identifiers with identical name (except casing) may generate
     compilation errors (e.g.  ‘shm_get’ vs ‘SHM_GET’).

The code is generated using Ada 2012 syntax, which makes it easier to
interface with other languages.  In most cases you can still use the
generated binding even if your code is compiled using earlier versions
of Ada (e.g.  ‘-gnat95’).

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Running the Binding Generator,  Next: Generating Bindings for C++ Headers,  Up: Generating Ada Bindings for C and C++ headers

3.11.5.1 Running the Binding Generator
......................................

The binding generator is part of the ‘gcc’ compiler and can be invoked
via the ‘-fdump-ada-spec’ switch, which will generate Ada spec files for
the header files specified on the command line, and all header files
needed by these files transitively.  For example:

     $ gcc -c -fdump-ada-spec -C /usr/include/time.h
     $ gcc -c *.ads

will generate, under GNU/Linux, the following files: ‘time_h.ads’,
‘bits_time_h.ads’, ‘stddef_h.ads’, ‘bits_types_h.ads’ which correspond
to the files ‘/usr/include/time.h’, ‘/usr/include/bits/time.h’, etc…,
and then compile these Ada specs.  That is to say, the name of the Ada
specs is in keeping with the relative path under ‘/usr/include/’ of the
header files.  This behavior is specific to paths ending with
‘/include/’; in all the other cases, the name of the Ada specs is
derived from the simple name of the header files instead.

The ‘-C’ switch tells ‘gcc’ to extract comments from headers, and will
attempt to generate corresponding Ada comments.

If you want to generate a single Ada file and not the transitive
closure, you can use instead the ‘-fdump-ada-spec-slim’ switch.

You can optionally specify a parent unit, of which all generated units
will be children, using ‘-fada-spec-parent=`unit'’.

The simple ‘gcc’-based command works only for C headers.  For C++
headers you need to use either the ‘g++’ command or the combination ‘gcc
-x c++’.

In some cases, the generated bindings will be more complete or more
meaningful when defining some macros, which you can do via the ‘-D’
switch.  This is for example the case with ‘Xlib.h’ under GNU/Linux:

     $ gcc -c -fdump-ada-spec -DXLIB_ILLEGAL_ACCESS -C /usr/include/X11/Xlib.h

The above will generate more complete bindings than a straight call
without the ‘-DXLIB_ILLEGAL_ACCESS’ switch.

In other cases, it is not possible to parse a header file in a
stand-alone manner, because other include files need to be included
first.  In this case, the solution is to create a small header file
including the needed ‘#include’ and possible ‘#define’ directives.  For
example, to generate Ada bindings for ‘readline/readline.h’, you need to
first include ‘stdio.h’, so you can create a file with the following two
lines in e.g.  ‘readline1.h’:

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <readline/readline.h>

and then generate Ada bindings from this file:

     $ gcc -c -fdump-ada-spec readline1.h

3.11.5.2 Generating Bindings for C++ Headers
............................................

Generating bindings for C++ headers is done using the same options,
always with the ‘g++’ compiler.  Note that generating Ada spec from C++
headers is a much more complex job and support for C++ headers is much
more limited that support for C headers.  As a result, you will need to
modify the resulting bindings by hand more extensively when using C++
headers.

In this mode, C++ classes will be mapped to Ada tagged types,
constructors will be mapped using the ‘CPP_Constructor’ pragma, and when
possible, multiple inheritance of abstract classes will be mapped to Ada
interfaces (see the ‘Interfacing to C++’ section in the ‘GNAT Reference
Manual’ for additional information on interfacing to C++).

For example, given the following C++ header file:

     class Carnivore {
     public:
        virtual int Number_Of_Teeth () = 0;
     };

     class Domestic {
     public:
        virtual void Set_Owner (char* Name) = 0;
     };

     class Animal {
     public:
       int Age_Count;
       virtual void Set_Age (int New_Age);
     };

     class Dog : Animal, Carnivore, Domestic {
      public:
       int  Tooth_Count;
       char *Owner;

       virtual int  Number_Of_Teeth ();
       virtual void Set_Owner (char* Name);

       Dog();
     };

The corresponding Ada code is generated:

     package Class_Carnivore is
       type Carnivore is limited interface;
       pragma Import (CPP, Carnivore);

       function Number_Of_Teeth (this : access Carnivore) return int is abstract;
     end;
     use Class_Carnivore;

     package Class_Domestic is
       type Domestic is limited interface;
       pragma Import (CPP, Domestic);

       procedure Set_Owner
         (this : access Domestic;
          Name : Interfaces.C.Strings.chars_ptr) is abstract;
     end;
     use Class_Domestic;

     package Class_Animal is
       type Animal is tagged limited record
         Age_Count : aliased int;
       end record;
       pragma Import (CPP, Animal);

       procedure Set_Age (this : access Animal; New_Age : int);
       pragma Import (CPP, Set_Age, "_ZN6Animal7Set_AgeEi");
     end;
     use Class_Animal;

     package Class_Dog is
       type Dog is new Animal and Carnivore and Domestic with record
         Tooth_Count : aliased int;
         Owner : Interfaces.C.Strings.chars_ptr;
       end record;
       pragma Import (CPP, Dog);

       function Number_Of_Teeth (this : access Dog) return int;
       pragma Import (CPP, Number_Of_Teeth, "_ZN3Dog15Number_Of_TeethEv");

       procedure Set_Owner
         (this : access Dog; Name : Interfaces.C.Strings.chars_ptr);
       pragma Import (CPP, Set_Owner, "_ZN3Dog9Set_OwnerEPc");

       function New_Dog return Dog;
       pragma CPP_Constructor (New_Dog);
       pragma Import (CPP, New_Dog, "_ZN3DogC1Ev");
     end;
     use Class_Dog;

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Running the C Header Generator,  Up: Generating C Headers for Ada Specifications

3.11.6.1 Running the C Header Generator
.......................................

The C header generator is part of the GNAT compiler and can be invoked
via the ‘-gnatceg’ combination of switches, which will generate a ‘.h’
file corresponding to the given input file (Ada spec or body).  Note
that only spec files are processed in any case, so giving a spec or a
body file as input is equivalent.  For example:

     $ gcc -c -gnatceg pack1.ads

will generate a self-contained file called ‘pack1.h’ including common
definitions from the Ada Standard package, followed by the definitions
included in ‘pack1.ads’, as well as all the other units withed by this
file.

For instance, given the following Ada files:

     package Pack2 is
        type Int is range 1 .. 10;
     end Pack2;

     with Pack2;

     package Pack1 is
        type Rec is record
           Field1, Field2 : Pack2.Int;
        end record;

        Global : Rec := (1, 2);

        procedure Proc1 (R : Rec);
        procedure Proc2 (R : in out Rec);
     end Pack1;

The above ‘gcc’ command will generate the following ‘pack1.h’ file:

     /* Standard definitions skipped */
     #ifndef PACK2_ADS
     #define PACK2_ADS
     typedef short_short_integer pack2__TintB;
     typedef pack2__TintB pack2__int;
     #endif /* PACK2_ADS */

     #ifndef PACK1_ADS
     #define PACK1_ADS
     typedef struct _pack1__rec {
       pack2__int field1;
       pack2__int field2;
     } pack1__rec;
     extern pack1__rec pack1__global;
     extern void pack1__proc1(const pack1__rec r);
     extern void pack1__proc2(pack1__rec *r);
     #endif /* PACK1_ADS */

You can then ‘include’ ‘pack1.h’ from a C source file and use the types,
call subprograms, reference objects, and constants.

3.12.1 Comparison between GNAT and C/C++ Compilation Models
-----------------------------------------------------------

The GNAT model of compilation is close to the C and C++ models.  You can
think of Ada specs as corresponding to header files in C. As in C, you
don’t need to compile specs; they are compiled when they are used.  The
Ada ‘with’ is similar in effect to the ‘#include’ of a C header.

One notable difference is that, in Ada, you may compile specs separately
to check them for semantic and syntactic accuracy.  This is not always
possible with C headers because they are fragments of programs that have
less specific syntactic or semantic rules.

The other major difference is the requirement for running the binder,
which performs two important functions.  First, it checks for
consistency.  In C or C++, the only defense against assembling
inconsistent programs lies outside the compiler, in a makefile, for
example.  The binder satisfies the Ada requirement that it be impossible
to construct an inconsistent program when the compiler is used in normal
mode.

The other important function of the binder is to deal with elaboration
issues.  There are also elaboration issues in C++ that are handled
automatically.  This automatic handling has the advantage of being
simpler to use, but the C++ programmer has no control over elaboration.
Where ‘gnatbind’ might complain there was no valid order of elaboration,
a C++ compiler would simply construct a program that malfunctioned at
run time.

3.12.2 Comparison between GNAT and Conventional Ada Library Models
------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is intended for Ada programmers who have used an Ada
compiler implementing the traditional Ada library model, as described in
the Ada Reference Manual.

In GNAT, there is no ‘library’ in the normal sense.  Instead, the set of
source files themselves acts as the library.  Compiling Ada programs
does not generate any centralized information, but rather an object file
and a ALI file, which are of interest only to the binder and linker.  In
a traditional system, the compiler reads information not only from the
source file being compiled, but also from the centralized library.  This
means that the effect of a compilation depends on what has been
previously compiled.  In particular:

   * When a unit is ‘with’ed, the unit seen by the compiler corresponds
     to the version of the unit most recently compiled into the library.

   * Inlining is effective only if the necessary body has already been
     compiled into the library.

   * Compiling a unit may obsolete other units in the library.

In GNAT, compiling one unit never affects the compilation of any other
units because the compiler reads only source files.  Only changes to
source files can affect the results of a compilation.  In particular:

   * When a unit is ‘with’ed, the unit seen by the compiler corresponds
     to the source version of the unit that is currently accessible to
     the compiler.

   * Inlining requires the appropriate source files for the package or
     subprogram bodies to be available to the compiler.  Inlining is
     always effective, independent of the order in which units are
     compiled.

   * Compiling a unit never affects any other compilations.  The editing
     of sources may cause previous compilations to be out of date if
     they depended on the source file being modified.

The most important result of these differences is that order of
compilation is never significant in GNAT. There is no situation in which
one is required to do one compilation before another.  What shows up as
order of compilation requirements in the traditional Ada library
becomes, in GNAT, simple source dependencies; in other words, there is
only a set of rules saying what source files must be present when a file
is compiled.

3.13.1 Using Other Utility Programs with GNAT
---------------------------------------------

The object files generated by GNAT are in standard system format and in
particular the debugging information uses this format.  This means
programs generated by GNAT can be used with existing utilities that
depend on these formats.

In general, any utility program that works with C will also often work
with Ada programs generated by GNAT. This includes software utilities
such as gprof (a profiling program), gdb (the FSF debugger), and
utilities such as Purify.

3.13.2 The External Symbol Naming Scheme of GNAT
------------------------------------------------

In order to interpret the output from GNAT, when using tools that are
originally intended for use with other languages, it is useful to
understand the conventions used to generate link names from the Ada
entity names.

All link names are in all lowercase letters.  With the exception of
library procedure names, the mechanism used is simply to use the full
expanded Ada name with dots replaced by double underscores.  For
example, suppose we have the following package spec:

     package QRS is
        MN : Integer;
     end QRS;

The variable ‘MN’ has a full expanded Ada name of ‘QRS.MN’, so the
corresponding link name is ‘qrs__mn’.  Of course if a ‘pragma Export’ is
used this may be overridden:

     package Exports is
        Var1 : Integer;
        pragma Export (Var1, C, External_Name => "var1_name");
        Var2 : Integer;
        pragma Export (Var2, C, Link_Name => "var2_link_name");
     end Exports;

In this case, the link name for ‘Var1’ is whatever link name the C
compiler would assign for the C function ‘var1_name’.  This typically
would be either ‘var1_name’ or ‘_var1_name’, depending on operating
system conventions, but other possibilities exist.  The link name for
‘Var2’ is ‘var2_link_name’, and this is not operating system dependent.

One exception occurs for library level procedures.  A potential
ambiguity arises between the required name ‘_main’ for the C main
program, and the name we would otherwise assign to an Ada library level
procedure called ‘Main’ (which might well not be the main program).

To avoid this ambiguity, we attach the prefix ‘_ada_’ to such names.  So
if we have a library level procedure such as:

     procedure Hello (S : String);

the external name of this procedure will be ‘_ada_hello’.

4 Building Executable Programs with GNAT
****************************************

This chapter describes first the gnatmake tool (*note Building with
gnatmake: c8.), which automatically determines the set of sources needed
by an Ada compilation unit and executes the necessary (re)compilations,
binding and linking.  It also explains how to use each tool
individually: the compiler (gcc, see *note Compiling with gcc: c9.),
binder (gnatbind, see *note Binding with gnatbind: ca.), and linker
(gnatlink, see *note Linking with gnatlink: cb.) to build executable
programs.  Finally, this chapter provides examples of how to make use of
the general GNU make mechanism in a GNAT context (see *note Using the
GNU make Utility: 70.).

4.1 Building with ‘gnatmake’
============================

A typical development cycle when working on an Ada program consists of
the following steps:

  1. Edit some sources to fix bugs;

  2. Add enhancements;

  3. Compile all sources affected;

  4. Rebind and relink; and

  5. Test.

The third step in particular can be tricky, because not only do the
modified files have to be compiled, but any files depending on these
files must also be recompiled.  The dependency rules in Ada can be quite
complex, especially in the presence of overloading, ‘use’ clauses,
generics and inlined subprograms.

‘gnatmake’ automatically takes care of the third and fourth steps of
this process.  It determines which sources need to be compiled, compiles
them, and binds and links the resulting object files.

Unlike some other Ada make programs, the dependencies are always
accurately recomputed from the new sources.  The source based approach
of the GNAT compilation model makes this possible.  This means that if
changes to the source program cause corresponding changes in
dependencies, they will always be tracked exactly correctly by
‘gnatmake’.

Note that for advanced forms of project structure, we recommend creating
a project file as explained in the ‘GNAT_Project_Manager’ chapter in the
‘GPRbuild User’s Guide’, and using the ‘gprbuild’ tool which supports
building with project files and works similarly to ‘gnatmake’.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Running gnatmake,  Next: Switches for gnatmake,  Up: Building with gnatmake

4.1.1 Running ‘gnatmake’
------------------------

The usual form of the ‘gnatmake’ command is

     $ gnatmake [<switches>] <file_name> [<file_names>] [<mode_switches>]

The only required argument is one ‘file_name’, which specifies a
compilation unit that is a main program.  Several ‘file_names’ can be
specified: this will result in several executables being built.  If
‘switches’ are present, they can be placed before the first ‘file_name’,
between ‘file_names’ or after the last ‘file_name’.  If ‘mode_switches’
are present, they must always be placed after the last ‘file_name’ and
all ‘switches’.

If you are using standard file extensions (‘.adb’ and ‘.ads’), then the
extension may be omitted from the ‘file_name’ arguments.  However, if
you are using non-standard extensions, then it is required that the
extension be given.  A relative or absolute directory path can be
specified in a ‘file_name’, in which case, the input source file will be
searched for in the specified directory only.  Otherwise, the input
source file will first be searched in the directory where ‘gnatmake’ was
invoked and if it is not found, it will be search on the source path of
the compiler as described in *note Search Paths and the Run-Time Library
(RTL): 73.

All ‘gnatmake’ output (except when you specify ‘-M’) is sent to
‘stderr’.  The output produced by the ‘-M’ switch is sent to ‘stdout’.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Switches for gnatmake,  Next: Mode Switches for gnatmake,  Prev: Running gnatmake,  Up: Building with gnatmake

4.1.2 Switches for ‘gnatmake’
-----------------------------

You may specify any of the following switches to ‘gnatmake’:

‘--version’

     Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

‘--help’

     If ‘--version’ was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
     all other options.

‘-P`project'’

     Build GNAT project file ‘project’ using GPRbuild.  When this switch
     is present, all other command-line switches are treated as GPRbuild
     switches and not ‘gnatmake’ switches.

‘--GCC=`compiler_name'’

     Program used for compiling.  The default is ‘gcc’.  You need to use
     quotes around ‘compiler_name’ if ‘compiler_name’ contains spaces or
     other separator characters.  As an example ‘--GCC="foo -x -y"’ will
     instruct ‘gnatmake’ to use ‘foo -x -y’ as your compiler.  A
     limitation of this syntax is that the name and path name of the
     executable itself must not include any embedded spaces.  Note that
     switch ‘-c’ is always inserted after your command name.  Thus in
     the above example the compiler command that will be used by
     ‘gnatmake’ will be ‘foo -c -x -y’.  If several
     ‘--GCC=compiler_name’ are used, only the last ‘compiler_name’ is
     taken into account.  However, all the additional switches are also
     taken into account.  Thus, ‘--GCC="foo -x -y" --GCC="bar -z -t"’ is
     equivalent to ‘--GCC="bar -x -y -z -t"’.

‘--GNATBIND=`binder_name'’

     Program used for binding.  The default is ‘gnatbind’.  You need to
     use quotes around ‘binder_name’ if ‘binder_name’ contains spaces or
     other separator characters.  As an example ‘--GNATBIND="bar -x -y"’
     will instruct ‘gnatmake’ to use ‘bar -x -y’ as your binder.  Binder
     switches that are normally appended by ‘gnatmake’ to ‘gnatbind’ are
     now appended to the end of ‘bar -x -y’.  A limitation of this
     syntax is that the name and path name of the executable itself must
     not include any embedded spaces.

‘--GNATLINK=`linker_name'’

     Program used for linking.  The default is ‘gnatlink’.  You need to
     use quotes around ‘linker_name’ if ‘linker_name’ contains spaces or
     other separator characters.  As an example ‘--GNATLINK="lan -x -y"’
     will instruct ‘gnatmake’ to use ‘lan -x -y’ as your linker.  Linker
     switches that are normally appended by ‘gnatmake’ to ‘gnatlink’ are
     now appended to the end of ‘lan -x -y’.  A limitation of this
     syntax is that the name and path name of the executable itself must
     not include any embedded spaces.

‘--create-map-file’

     When linking an executable, create a map file.  The name of the map
     file has the same name as the executable with extension “.map”.

‘--create-map-file=`mapfile'’

     When linking an executable, create a map file with the specified
     name.

‘--create-missing-dirs’

     When using project files (‘-P`project'’), automatically create
     missing object directories, library directories and exec
     directories.

‘--single-compile-per-obj-dir’

     Disallow simultaneous compilations in the same object directory
     when project files are used.

‘--subdirs=`subdir'’

     Actual object directory of each project file is the subdirectory
     subdir of the object directory specified or defaulted in the
     project file.

‘--unchecked-shared-lib-imports’

     By default, shared library projects are not allowed to import
     static library projects.  When this switch is used on the command
     line, this restriction is relaxed.

‘--source-info=`source info file'’

     Specify a source info file.  This switch is active only when
     project files are used.  If the source info file is specified as a
     relative path, then it is relative to the object directory of the
     main project.  If the source info file does not exist, then after
     the Project Manager has successfully parsed and processed the
     project files and found the sources, it creates the source info
     file.  If the source info file already exists and can be read
     successfully, then the Project Manager will get all the needed
     information about the sources from the source info file and will
     not look for them.  This reduces the time to process the project
     files, especially when looking for sources that take a long time.
     If the source info file exists but cannot be parsed successfully,
     the Project Manager will attempt to recreate it.  If the Project
     Manager fails to create the source info file, a message is issued,
     but gnatmake does not fail.  ‘gnatmake’ “trusts” the source info
     file.  This means that if the source files have changed (addition,
     deletion, moving to a different source directory), then the source
     info file need to be deleted and recreated.

‘-a’

     Consider all files in the make process, even the GNAT internal
     system files (for example, the predefined Ada library files), as
     well as any locked files.  Locked files are files whose ALI file is
     write-protected.  By default, ‘gnatmake’ does not check these
     files, because the assumption is that the GNAT internal files are
     properly up to date, and also that any write protected ALI files
     have been properly installed.  Note that if there is an
     installation problem, such that one of these files is not up to
     date, it will be properly caught by the binder.  You may have to
     specify this switch if you are working on GNAT itself.  The switch
     ‘-a’ is also useful in conjunction with ‘-f’ if you need to
     recompile an entire application, including run-time files, using
     special configuration pragmas, such as a ‘Normalize_Scalars’
     pragma.

     By default ‘gnatmake -a’ compiles all GNAT internal files with ‘gcc
     -c -gnatpg’ rather than ‘gcc -c’.

‘-b’

     Bind only.  Can be combined with ‘-c’ to do compilation and
     binding, but no link.  Can be combined with ‘-l’ to do binding and
     linking.  When not combined with ‘-c’ all the units in the closure
     of the main program must have been previously compiled and must be
     up to date.  The root unit specified by ‘file_name’ may be given
     without extension, with the source extension or, if no GNAT Project
     File is specified, with the ALI file extension.

‘-c’

     Compile only.  Do not perform binding, except when ‘-b’ is also
     specified.  Do not perform linking, except if both ‘-b’ and ‘-l’
     are also specified.  If the root unit specified by ‘file_name’ is
     not a main unit, this is the default.  Otherwise ‘gnatmake’ will
     attempt binding and linking unless all objects are up to date and
     the executable is more recent than the objects.

‘-C’

     Use a temporary mapping file.  A mapping file is a way to
     communicate to the compiler two mappings: from unit names to file
     names (without any directory information) and from file names to
     path names (with full directory information).  A mapping file can
     make the compiler’s file searches faster, especially if there are
     many source directories, or the sources are read over a slow
     network connection.  If ‘-P’ is used, a mapping file is always
     used, so ‘-C’ is unnecessary; in this case the mapping file is
     initially populated based on the project file.  If ‘-C’ is used
     without ‘-P’, the mapping file is initially empty.  Each invocation
     of the compiler will add any newly accessed sources to the mapping
     file.

‘-C=`file'’

     Use a specific mapping file.  The file, specified as a path name
     (absolute or relative) by this switch, should already exist,
     otherwise the switch is ineffective.  The specified mapping file
     will be communicated to the compiler.  This switch is not
     compatible with a project file (-P‘file‘) or with multiple
     compiling processes (-jnnn, when nnn is greater than 1).

‘-d’

     Display progress for each source, up to date or not, as a single
     line:

          completed x out of y (zz%)

     If the file needs to be compiled this is displayed after the
     invocation of the compiler.  These lines are displayed even in
     quiet output mode.

‘-D `dir'’

     Put all object files and ALI file in directory ‘dir’.  If the ‘-D’
     switch is not used, all object files and ALI files go in the
     current working directory.

     This switch cannot be used when using a project file.

‘-eI`nnn'’

     Indicates that the main source is a multi-unit source and the rank
     of the unit in the source file is nnn.  nnn needs to be a positive
     number and a valid index in the source.  This switch cannot be used
     when ‘gnatmake’ is invoked for several mains.

‘-eL’

     Follow all symbolic links when processing project files.  This
     should be used if your project uses symbolic links for files or
     directories, but is not needed in other cases.

     This also assumes that no directory matches the naming scheme for
     files (for instance that you do not have a directory called
     “sources.ads” when using the default GNAT naming scheme).

     When you do not have to use this switch (i.e., by default),
     gnatmake is able to save a lot of system calls (several per source
     file and object file), which can result in a significant speed up
     to load and manipulate a project file, especially when using source
     files from a remote system.

‘-eS’

     Output the commands for the compiler, the binder and the linker on
     standard output, instead of standard error.

‘-f’

     Force recompilations.  Recompile all sources, even though some
     object files may be up to date, but don’t recompile predefined or
     GNAT internal files or locked files (files with a write-protected
     ALI file), unless the ‘-a’ switch is also specified.

‘-F’

     When using project files, if some errors or warnings are detected
     during parsing and verbose mode is not in effect (no use of switch
     -v), then error lines start with the full path name of the project
     file, rather than its simple file name.

‘-g’

     Enable debugging.  This switch is simply passed to the compiler and
     to the linker.

‘-i’

     In normal mode, ‘gnatmake’ compiles all object files and ALI files
     into the current directory.  If the ‘-i’ switch is used, then
     instead object files and ALI files that already exist are
     overwritten in place.  This means that once a large project is
     organized into separate directories in the desired manner, then
     ‘gnatmake’ will automatically maintain and update this
     organization.  If no ALI files are found on the Ada object path
     (see *note Search Paths and the Run-Time Library (RTL): 73.), the
     new object and ALI files are created in the directory containing
     the source being compiled.  If another organization is desired,
     where objects and sources are kept in different directories, a
     useful technique is to create dummy ALI files in the desired
     directories.  When detecting such a dummy file, ‘gnatmake’ will be
     forced to recompile the corresponding source file, and it will be
     put the resulting object and ALI files in the directory where it
     found the dummy file.

‘-j`n'’

     Use ‘n’ processes to carry out the (re)compilations.  On a
     multiprocessor machine compilations will occur in parallel.  If ‘n’
     is 0, then the maximum number of parallel compilations is the
     number of core processors on the platform.  In the event of
     compilation errors, messages from various compilations might get
     interspersed (but ‘gnatmake’ will give you the full ordered list of
     failing compiles at the end).  If this is problematic, rerun the
     make process with n set to 1 to get a clean list of messages.

‘-k’

     Keep going.  Continue as much as possible after a compilation
     error.  To ease the programmer’s task in case of compilation
     errors, the list of sources for which the compile fails is given
     when ‘gnatmake’ terminates.

     If ‘gnatmake’ is invoked with several ‘file_names’ and with this
     switch, if there are compilation errors when building an
     executable, ‘gnatmake’ will not attempt to build the following
     executables.

‘-l’

     Link only.  Can be combined with ‘-b’ to binding and linking.
     Linking will not be performed if combined with ‘-c’ but not with
     ‘-b’.  When not combined with ‘-b’ all the units in the closure of
     the main program must have been previously compiled and must be up
     to date, and the main program needs to have been bound.  The root
     unit specified by ‘file_name’ may be given without extension, with
     the source extension or, if no GNAT Project File is specified, with
     the ALI file extension.

‘-m’

     Specify that the minimum necessary amount of recompilations be
     performed.  In this mode ‘gnatmake’ ignores time stamp differences
     when the only modifications to a source file consist in
     adding/removing comments, empty lines, spaces or tabs.  This means
     that if you have changed the comments in a source file or have
     simply reformatted it, using this switch will tell ‘gnatmake’ not
     to recompile files that depend on it (provided other sources on
     which these files depend have undergone no semantic modifications).
     Note that the debugging information may be out of date with respect
     to the sources if the ‘-m’ switch causes a compilation to be
     switched, so the use of this switch represents a trade-off between
     compilation time and accurate debugging information.

‘-M’

     Check if all objects are up to date.  If they are, output the
     object dependences to ‘stdout’ in a form that can be directly
     exploited in a ‘Makefile’.  By default, each source file is
     prefixed with its (relative or absolute) directory name.  This name
     is whatever you specified in the various ‘-aI’ and ‘-I’ switches.
     If you use ‘gnatmake -M’ ‘-q’ (see below), only the source file
     names, without relative paths, are output.  If you just specify the
     ‘-M’ switch, dependencies of the GNAT internal system files are
     omitted.  This is typically what you want.  If you also specify the
     ‘-a’ switch, dependencies of the GNAT internal files are also
     listed.  Note that dependencies of the objects in external Ada
     libraries (see switch ‘-aL`dir'’ in the following list) are never
     reported.

‘-n’

     Don’t compile, bind, or link.  Checks if all objects are up to
     date.  If they are not, the full name of the first file that needs
     to be recompiled is printed.  Repeated use of this option, followed
     by compiling the indicated source file, will eventually result in
     recompiling all required units.

‘-o `exec_name'’

     Output executable name.  The name of the final executable program
     will be ‘exec_name’.  If the ‘-o’ switch is omitted the default
     name for the executable will be the name of the input file in
     appropriate form for an executable file on the host system.

     This switch cannot be used when invoking ‘gnatmake’ with several
     ‘file_names’.

‘-p’

     Same as ‘--create-missing-dirs’

‘-q’

     Quiet.  When this flag is not set, the commands carried out by
     ‘gnatmake’ are displayed.

‘-s’

     Recompile if compiler switches have changed since last compilation.
     All compiler switches but -I and -o are taken into account in the
     following way: orders between different ‘first letter’ switches are
     ignored, but orders between same switches are taken into account.
     For example, ‘-O -O2’ is different than ‘-O2 -O’, but ‘-g -O’ is
     equivalent to ‘-O -g’.

     This switch is recommended when Integrated Preprocessing is used.

‘-u’

     Unique.  Recompile at most the main files.  It implies -c.
     Combined with -f, it is equivalent to calling the compiler
     directly.  Note that using -u with a project file and no main has a
     special meaning.

‘-U’

     When used without a project file or with one or several mains on
     the command line, is equivalent to -u.  When used with a project
     file and no main on the command line, all sources of all project
     files are checked and compiled if not up to date, and libraries are
     rebuilt, if necessary.

‘-v’

     Verbose.  Display the reason for all recompilations ‘gnatmake’
     decides are necessary, with the highest verbosity level.

‘-vl’

     Verbosity level Low.  Display fewer lines than in verbosity Medium.

‘-vm’

     Verbosity level Medium.  Potentially display fewer lines than in
     verbosity High.

‘-vh’

     Verbosity level High.  Equivalent to -v.

‘-vP`x'’

     Indicate the verbosity of the parsing of GNAT project files.  See
     *note Switches Related to Project Files: d1.

‘-x’

     Indicate that sources that are not part of any Project File may be
     compiled.  Normally, when using Project Files, only sources that
     are part of a Project File may be compile.  When this switch is
     used, a source outside of all Project Files may be compiled.  The
     ALI file and the object file will be put in the object directory of
     the main Project.  The compilation switches used will only be those
     specified on the command line.  Even when ‘-x’ is used, mains
     specified on the command line need to be sources of a project file.

‘-X`name'=`value'’

     Indicate that external variable ‘name’ has the value ‘value’.  The
     Project Manager will use this value for occurrences of
     ‘external(name)’ when parsing the project file.  *note Switches
     Related to Project Files: d1.

‘-z’

     No main subprogram.  Bind and link the program even if the unit
     name given on the command line is a package name.  The resulting
     executable will execute the elaboration routines of the package and
     its closure, then the finalization routines.

GCC switches
............

Any uppercase or multi-character switch that is not a ‘gnatmake’ switch
is passed to ‘gcc’ (e.g., ‘-O’, ‘-gnato,’ etc.)

Source and library search path switches
.......................................

‘-aI`dir'’

     When looking for source files also look in directory ‘dir’.  The
     order in which source files search is undertaken is described in
     *note Search Paths and the Run-Time Library (RTL): 73.

‘-aL`dir'’

     Consider ‘dir’ as being an externally provided Ada library.
     Instructs ‘gnatmake’ to skip compilation units whose ‘.ALI’ files
     have been located in directory ‘dir’.  This allows you to have
     missing bodies for the units in ‘dir’ and to ignore out of date
     bodies for the same units.  You still need to specify the location
     of the specs for these units by using the switches ‘-aI`dir'’ or
     ‘-I`dir'’.  Note: this switch is provided for compatibility with
     previous versions of ‘gnatmake’.  The easier method of causing
     standard libraries to be excluded from consideration is to
     write-protect the corresponding ALI files.

‘-aO`dir'’

     When searching for library and object files, look in directory
     ‘dir’.  The order in which library files are searched is described
     in *note Search Paths for gnatbind: 76.

‘-A`dir'’

     Equivalent to ‘-aL`dir'’ ‘-aI`dir'’.

‘-I`dir'’

     Equivalent to ‘-aO`dir' -aI`dir'’.

‘-I-’

     Do not look for source files in the directory containing the source
     file named in the command line.  Do not look for ALI or object
     files in the directory where ‘gnatmake’ was invoked.

‘-L`dir'’

     Add directory ‘dir’ to the list of directories in which the linker
     will search for libraries.  This is equivalent to ‘-largs’
     ‘-L`dir'’.  Furthermore, under Windows, the sources pointed to by
     the libraries path set in the registry are not searched for.

‘-nostdinc’

     Do not look for source files in the system default directory.

‘-nostdlib’

     Do not look for library files in the system default directory.

‘--RTS=`rts-path'’

     Specifies the default location of the run-time library.  GNAT looks
     for the run-time in the following directories, and stops as soon as
     a valid run-time is found (‘adainclude’ or ‘ada_source_path’, and
     ‘adalib’ or ‘ada_object_path’ present):

        * ‘<current directory>/$rts_path’

        * ‘<default-search-dir>/$rts_path’

        * ‘<default-search-dir>/rts-$rts_path’

        * The selected path is handled like a normal RTS path.

4.1.3 Mode Switches for ‘gnatmake’
----------------------------------

The mode switches (referred to as ‘mode_switches’) allow the inclusion
of switches that are to be passed to the compiler itself, the binder or
the linker.  The effect of a mode switch is to cause all subsequent
switches up to the end of the switch list, or up to the next mode
switch, to be interpreted as switches to be passed on to the designated
component of GNAT.

‘-cargs `switches'’

     Compiler switches.  Here ‘switches’ is a list of switches that are
     valid switches for ‘gcc’.  They will be passed on to all compile
     steps performed by ‘gnatmake’.

‘-bargs `switches'’

     Binder switches.  Here ‘switches’ is a list of switches that are
     valid switches for ‘gnatbind’.  They will be passed on to all bind
     steps performed by ‘gnatmake’.

‘-largs `switches'’

     Linker switches.  Here ‘switches’ is a list of switches that are
     valid switches for ‘gnatlink’.  They will be passed on to all link
     steps performed by ‘gnatmake’.

‘-margs `switches'’

     Make switches.  The switches are directly interpreted by
     ‘gnatmake’, regardless of any previous occurrence of ‘-cargs’,
     ‘-bargs’ or ‘-largs’.

4.1.4 Notes on the Command Line
-------------------------------

This section contains some additional useful notes on the operation of
the ‘gnatmake’ command.

   * If ‘gnatmake’ finds no ALI files, it recompiles the main program
     and all other units required by the main program.  This means that
     ‘gnatmake’ can be used for the initial compile, as well as during
     subsequent steps of the development cycle.

   * If you enter ‘gnatmake foo.adb’, where ‘foo’ is a subunit or body
     of a generic unit, ‘gnatmake’ recompiles ‘foo.adb’ (because it
     finds no ALI) and stops, issuing a warning.

   * In ‘gnatmake’ the switch ‘-I’ is used to specify both source and
     library file paths.  Use ‘-aI’ instead if you just want to specify
     source paths only and ‘-aO’ if you want to specify library paths
     only.

   * ‘gnatmake’ will ignore any files whose ALI file is write-protected.
     This may conveniently be used to exclude standard libraries from
     consideration and in particular it means that the use of the ‘-f’
     switch will not recompile these files unless ‘-a’ is also
     specified.

   * ‘gnatmake’ has been designed to make the use of Ada libraries
     particularly convenient.  Assume you have an Ada library organized
     as follows: ‘obj-dir’ contains the objects and ALI files for of
     your Ada compilation units, whereas ‘include-dir’ contains the
     specs of these units, but no bodies.  Then to compile a unit stored
     in ‘main.adb’, which uses this Ada library you would just type:

          $ gnatmake -aI`include-dir`  -aL`obj-dir`  main

   * Using ‘gnatmake’ along with the ‘-m (minimal recompilation)’ switch
     provides a mechanism for avoiding unnecessary recompilations.
     Using this switch, you can update the comments/format of your
     source files without having to recompile everything.  Note,
     however, that adding or deleting lines in a source files may render
     its debugging info obsolete.  If the file in question is a spec,
     the impact is rather limited, as that debugging info will only be
     useful during the elaboration phase of your program.  For bodies
     the impact can be more significant.  In all events, your debugger
     will warn you if a source file is more recent than the
     corresponding object, and alert you to the fact that the debugging
     information may be out of date.

4.1.5 How ‘gnatmake’ Works
--------------------------

Generally ‘gnatmake’ automatically performs all necessary recompilations
and you don’t need to worry about how it works.  However, it may be
useful to have some basic understanding of the ‘gnatmake’ approach and
in particular to understand how it uses the results of previous
compilations without incorrectly depending on them.

First a definition: an object file is considered ‘up to date’ if the
corresponding ALI file exists and if all the source files listed in the
dependency section of this ALI file have time stamps matching those in
the ALI file.  This means that neither the source file itself nor any
files that it depends on have been modified, and hence there is no need
to recompile this file.

‘gnatmake’ works by first checking if the specified main unit is up to
date.  If so, no compilations are required for the main unit.  If not,
‘gnatmake’ compiles the main program to build a new ALI file that
reflects the latest sources.  Then the ALI file of the main unit is
examined to find all the source files on which the main program depends,
and ‘gnatmake’ recursively applies the above procedure on all these
files.

This process ensures that ‘gnatmake’ only trusts the dependencies in an
existing ALI file if they are known to be correct.  Otherwise it always
recompiles to determine a new, guaranteed accurate set of dependencies.
As a result the program is compiled ‘upside down’ from what may be more
familiar as the required order of compilation in some other Ada systems.
In particular, clients are compiled before the units on which they
depend.  The ability of GNAT to compile in any order is critical in
allowing an order of compilation to be chosen that guarantees that
‘gnatmake’ will recompute a correct set of new dependencies if
necessary.

When invoking ‘gnatmake’ with several ‘file_names’, if a unit is
imported by several of the executables, it will be recompiled at most
once.

Note: when using non-standard naming conventions (*note Using Other File
Names: 1c.), changing through a configuration pragmas file the version
of a source and invoking ‘gnatmake’ to recompile may have no effect, if
the previous version of the source is still accessible by ‘gnatmake’.
It may be necessary to use the switch -f.

4.1.6 Examples of ‘gnatmake’ Usage
----------------------------------

‘gnatmake hello.adb’

     Compile all files necessary to bind and link the main program
     ‘hello.adb’ (containing unit ‘Hello’) and bind and link the
     resulting object files to generate an executable file ‘hello’.

‘gnatmake main1 main2 main3’

     Compile all files necessary to bind and link the main programs
     ‘main1.adb’ (containing unit ‘Main1’), ‘main2.adb’ (containing unit
     ‘Main2’) and ‘main3.adb’ (containing unit ‘Main3’) and bind and
     link the resulting object files to generate three executable files
     ‘main1’, ‘main2’ and ‘main3’.

‘gnatmake -q Main_Unit -cargs -O2 -bargs -l’

     Compile all files necessary to bind and link the main program unit
     ‘Main_Unit’ (from file ‘main_unit.adb’).  All compilations will be
     done with optimization level 2 and the order of elaboration will be
     listed by the binder.  ‘gnatmake’ will operate in quiet mode, not
     displaying commands it is executing.

This section discusses how to compile Ada programs using the ‘gcc’

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Compiling Programs,  Next: Search Paths and the Run-Time Library RTL,  Up: Compiling with gcc

4.2.1 Compiling Programs
------------------------

The first step in creating an executable program is to compile the units
of the program using the ‘gcc’ command.  You must compile the following
files:

   * the body file (‘.adb’) for a library level subprogram or generic
     subprogram

   * the spec file (‘.ads’) for a library level package or generic
     package that has no body

   * the body file (‘.adb’) for a library level package or generic
     package that has a body

You need ‘not’ compile the following files

   * the spec of a library unit which has a body

   * subunits

because they are compiled as part of compiling related units.  GNAT
compiles package specs when the corresponding body is compiled, and
subunits when the parent is compiled.

If you attempt to compile any of these files, you will get one of the
following error messages (where ‘fff’ is the name of the file you
compiled):

          cannot generate code for file ``fff`` (package spec)
          to check package spec, use -gnatc

          cannot generate code for file ``fff`` (missing subunits)
          to check parent unit, use -gnatc

          cannot generate code for file ``fff`` (subprogram spec)
          to check subprogram spec, use -gnatc

          cannot generate code for file ``fff`` (subunit)
          to check subunit, use -gnatc

As indicated by the above error messages, if you want to submit one of
these files to the compiler to check for correct semantics without
generating code, then use the ‘-gnatc’ switch.

The basic command for compiling a file containing an Ada unit is:

     $ gcc -c [switches] <file name>

where ‘file name’ is the name of the Ada file (usually having an
extension ‘.ads’ for a spec or ‘.adb’ for a body).  You specify the ‘-c’
switch to tell ‘gcc’ to compile, but not link, the file.  The result of
a successful compilation is an object file, which has the same name as
the source file but an extension of ‘.o’ and an Ada Library Information
(ALI) file, which also has the same name as the source file, but with
‘.ali’ as the extension.  GNAT creates these two output files in the
current directory, but you may specify a source file in any directory
using an absolute or relative path specification containing the
directory information.

‘gcc’ is actually a driver program that looks at the extensions of the
file arguments and loads the appropriate compiler.  For example, the GNU
C compiler is ‘cc1’, and the Ada compiler is ‘gnat1’.  These programs
are in directories known to the driver program (in some configurations
via environment variables you set), but need not be in your path.  The
‘gcc’ driver also calls the assembler and any other utilities needed to
complete the generation of the required object files.

It is possible to supply several file names on the same ‘gcc’ command.
This causes ‘gcc’ to call the appropriate compiler for each file.  For
example, the following command lists two separate files to be compiled:

     $ gcc -c x.adb y.adb

calls ‘gnat1’ (the Ada compiler) twice to compile ‘x.adb’ and ‘y.adb’.
The compiler generates two object files ‘x.o’ and ‘y.o’ and the two ALI
files ‘x.ali’ and ‘y.ali’.

Any switches apply to all the files listed, see *note Compiler Switches:
dd. for a list of available ‘gcc’ switches.

4.2.2 Search Paths and the Run-Time Library (RTL)
-------------------------------------------------

With the GNAT source-based library system, the compiler must be able to
find source files for units that are needed by the unit being compiled.
Search paths are used to guide this process.

The compiler compiles one source file whose name must be given
explicitly on the command line.  In other words, no searching is done
for this file.  To find all other source files that are needed (the most
common being the specs of units), the compiler examines the following
directories, in the following order:

   * The directory containing the source file of the main unit being
     compiled (the file name on the command line).

   * Each directory named by an ‘-I’ switch given on the ‘gcc’ command
     line, in the order given.

   * Each of the directories listed in the text file whose name is given
     by the ‘ADA_PRJ_INCLUDE_FILE’ environment variable.
     ‘ADA_PRJ_INCLUDE_FILE’ is normally set by gnatmake or by the gnat
     driver when project files are used.  It should not normally be set
     by other means.

   * Each of the directories listed in the value of the
     ‘ADA_INCLUDE_PATH’ environment variable.  Construct this value
     exactly as the ‘PATH’ environment variable: a list of directory
     names separated by colons (semicolons when working with the NT
     version).

   * The content of the ‘ada_source_path’ file which is part of the GNAT
     installation tree and is used to store standard libraries such as
     the GNAT Run Time Library (RTL) source files.  See also *note
     Installing a library: 72.

Specifying the switch ‘-I-’ inhibits the use of the directory containing
the source file named in the command line.  You can still have this
directory on your search path, but in this case it must be explicitly
requested with a ‘-I’ switch.

Specifying the switch ‘-nostdinc’ inhibits the search of the default
location for the GNAT Run Time Library (RTL) source files.

The compiler outputs its object files and ALI files in the current
working directory.  Caution: The object file can be redirected with the
‘-o’ switch; however, ‘gcc’ and ‘gnat1’ have not been coordinated on
this so the ‘ALI’ file will not go to the right place.  Therefore, you
should avoid using the ‘-o’ switch.

The packages ‘Ada’, ‘System’, and ‘Interfaces’ and their children make
up the GNAT RTL, together with the simple ‘System.IO’ package used in
the ‘"Hello World"’ example.  The sources for these units are needed by
the compiler and are kept together in one directory.  Not all of the
bodies are needed, but all of the sources are kept together anyway.  In
a normal installation, you need not specify these directory names when
compiling or binding.  Either the environment variables or the built-in
defaults cause these files to be found.

In addition to the language-defined hierarchies (‘System’, ‘Ada’ and
‘Interfaces’), the GNAT distribution provides a fourth hierarchy,
consisting of child units of ‘GNAT’.  This is a collection of generally
useful types, subprograms, etc.  See the ‘GNAT_Reference_Manual’ for
further details.

Besides simplifying access to the RTL, a major use of search paths is in
compiling sources from multiple directories.  This can make development
environments much more flexible.

4.2.3 Order of Compilation Issues
---------------------------------

If, in our earlier example, there was a spec for the ‘hello’ procedure,
it would be contained in the file ‘hello.ads’; yet this file would not
have to be explicitly compiled.  This is the result of the model we
chose to implement library management.  Some of the consequences of this
model are as follows:

   * There is no point in compiling specs (except for package specs with
     no bodies) because these are compiled as needed by clients.  If you
     attempt a useless compilation, you will receive an error message.
     It is also useless to compile subunits because they are compiled as
     needed by the parent.

   * There are no order of compilation requirements: performing a
     compilation never obsoletes anything.  The only way you can
     obsolete something and require recompilations is to modify one of
     the source files on which it depends.

   * There is no library as such, apart from the ALI files (*note The
     Ada Library Information Files: 28, for information on the format of
     these files).  For now we find it convenient to create separate ALI
     files, but eventually the information therein may be incorporated
     into the object file directly.

   * When you compile a unit, the source files for the specs of all
     units that it ‘with’s, all its subunits, and the bodies of any
     generics it instantiates must be available (reachable by the
     search-paths mechanism described above), or you will receive a
     fatal error message.

These switches are fully described in this section: first an

More switches exist for GCC than those documented here, especially for
specific targets.  However, their use is not recommended as they may
change code generation in ways that are incompatible with the Ada

units.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Alphabetical List of All Switches,  Next: Output and Error Message Control,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.1 Alphabetical List of All Switches
---------------------------------------

‘-b `target'’

     Compile your program to run on ‘target’, which is the name of a
     system configuration.  You must have a GNAT cross-compiler built if
     ‘target’ is not the same as your host system.

‘-B`dir'’

     Load compiler executables (for example, ‘gnat1’, the Ada compiler)
     from ‘dir’ instead of the default location.  Only use this switch
     when multiple versions of the GNAT compiler are available.  See the
     “Options for Directory Search” section in the ‘Using the GNU
     Compiler Collection (GCC)’ manual for further details.  You would
     normally use the ‘-b’ or ‘-V’ switch instead.

‘-c’

     Compile.  Always use this switch when compiling Ada programs.

     Note: for some other languages when using ‘gcc’, notably in the
     case of C and C++, it is possible to use use ‘gcc’ without a ‘-c’
     switch to compile and link in one step.  In the case of GNAT, you
     cannot use this approach, because the binder must be run and ‘gcc’
     cannot be used to run the GNAT binder.

‘-fcallgraph-info[=su,da]’

     Makes the compiler output callgraph information for the program, on
     a per-file basis.  The information is generated in the VCG format.
     It can be decorated with additional, per-node and/or per-edge
     information, if a list of comma-separated markers is additionally
     specified.  When the ‘su’ marker is specified, the callgraph is
     decorated with stack usage information; it is equivalent to
     ‘-fstack-usage’.  When the ‘da’ marker is specified, the callgraph
     is decorated with information about dynamically allocated objects.

‘-fdiagnostics-format=json’

     Makes GNAT emit warning and error messages as JSON. Inhibits
     printing of text warning and errors messages except if ‘-gnatv’ or
     ‘-gnatl’ are present.  Uses absolute file paths when used along
     ‘-gnatef’.

‘-fdump-scos’

     Generates SCO (Source Coverage Obligation) information in the ALI
     file.  This information is used by advanced coverage tools.  See
     unit ‘SCOs’ in the compiler sources for details in files ‘scos.ads’
     and ‘scos.adb’.

‘-fgnat-encodings=[all|gdb|minimal]’

     This switch controls the balance between GNAT encodings and
     standard DWARF emitted in the debug information.

‘-flto[=`n']’

     Enables Link Time Optimization.  This switch must be used in
     conjunction with the ‘-Ox’ switches (but not with the ‘-gnatn’
     switch since it is a full replacement for the latter) and instructs
     the compiler to defer most optimizations until the link stage.  The
     advantage of this approach is that the compiler can do a
     whole-program analysis and choose the best interprocedural
     optimization strategy based on a complete view of the program,
     instead of a fragmentary view with the usual approach.  This can
     also speed up the compilation of big programs and reduce the size
     of the executable, compared with a traditional per-unit compilation
     with inlining across units enabled by the ‘-gnatn’ switch.  The
     drawback of this approach is that it may require more memory and
     that the debugging information generated by ‘-g’ with it might be
     hardly usable.  The switch, as well as the accompanying ‘-Ox’
     switches, must be specified both for the compilation and the link
     phases.  If the ‘n’ parameter is specified, the optimization and
     final code generation at link time are executed using ‘n’ parallel
     jobs by means of an installed ‘make’ program.

‘-fno-inline’

     Suppresses all inlining, unless requested with pragma
     ‘Inline_Always’.  The effect is enforced regardless of other
     optimization or inlining switches.  Note that inlining can also be
     suppressed on a finer-grained basis with pragma ‘No_Inline’.

‘-fno-inline-functions’

     Suppresses automatic inlining of subprograms, which is enabled if
     ‘-O3’ is used.

‘-fno-inline-small-functions’

     Suppresses automatic inlining of small subprograms, which is
     enabled if ‘-O2’ is used.

‘-fno-inline-functions-called-once’

     Suppresses inlining of subprograms local to the unit and called
     once from within it, which is enabled if ‘-O1’ is used.

‘-fno-ivopts’

     Suppresses high-level loop induction variable optimizations, which
     are enabled if ‘-O1’ is used.  These optimizations are generally
     profitable but, for some specific cases of loops with numerous uses
     of the iteration variable that follow a common pattern, they may
     end up destroying the regularity that could be exploited at a lower
     level and thus producing inferior code.

‘-fno-strict-aliasing’

     Causes the compiler to avoid assumptions regarding non-aliasing of
     objects of different types.  See *note Optimization and Strict
     Aliasing: e6. for details.

‘-fno-strict-overflow’

     Causes the compiler to avoid assumptions regarding the rules of
     signed integer overflow.  These rules specify that signed integer
     overflow will result in a Constraint_Error exception at run time
     and are enforced in default mode by the compiler, so this switch
     should not be necessary in normal operating mode.  It might be
     useful in conjunction with ‘-gnato0’ for very peculiar cases of
     low-level programming.

‘-fstack-check’

     Activates stack checking.  See *note Stack Overflow Checking: e7.
     for details.

‘-fstack-usage’

     Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program,
     on a per-subprogram basis.  See *note Static Stack Usage Analysis:
     e8. for details.

‘-g’

     Generate debugging information.  This information is stored in the
     object file and copied from there to the final executable file by
     the linker, where it can be read by the debugger.  You must use the
     ‘-g’ switch if you plan on using the debugger.

‘-gnat05’

     Allow full Ada 2005 features.

‘-gnat12’

     Allow full Ada 2012 features.

‘-gnat2005’

     Allow full Ada 2005 features (same as ‘-gnat05’)

‘-gnat2012’

     Allow full Ada 2012 features (same as ‘-gnat12’)

‘-gnat2022’

     Allow full Ada 2022 features

‘-gnat83’

     Enforce Ada 83 restrictions.

‘-gnat95’

     Enforce Ada 95 restrictions.

     Note: for compatibility with some Ada 95 compilers which support
     only the ‘overriding’ keyword of Ada 2005, the ‘-gnatd.D’ switch
     can be used along with ‘-gnat95’ to achieve a similar effect with
     GNAT.

     ‘-gnatd.D’ instructs GNAT to consider ‘overriding’ as a keyword and
     handle its associated semantic checks, even in Ada 95 mode.

‘-gnata’

     Assertions enabled.  ‘Pragma Assert’ and ‘pragma Debug’ to be
     activated.  Note that these pragmas can also be controlled using
     the configuration pragmas ‘Assertion_Policy’ and ‘Debug_Policy’.
     It also activates pragmas ‘Check’, ‘Precondition’, and
     ‘Postcondition’.  Note that these pragmas can also be controlled
     using the configuration pragma ‘Check_Policy’.  In Ada 2012, it
     also activates all assertions defined in the RM as aspects:
     preconditions, postconditions, type invariants and (sub)type
     predicates.  In all Ada modes, corresponding pragmas for type
     invariants and (sub)type predicates are also activated.  The
     default is that all these assertions are disabled, and have no
     effect, other than being checked for syntactic validity, and in the
     case of subtype predicates, constructions such as membership tests
     still test predicates even if assertions are turned off.

‘-gnatA’

     Avoid processing ‘gnat.adc’.  If a ‘gnat.adc’ file is present, it
     will be ignored.

‘-gnatb’

     Generate brief messages to ‘stderr’ even if verbose mode set.

‘-gnatB’

     Assume no invalid (bad) values except for ‘Valid attribute use
     (*note Validity Checking: e9.).

‘-gnatc’

     Check syntax and semantics only (no code generation attempted).
     When the compiler is invoked by ‘gnatmake’, if the switch ‘-gnatc’
     is only given to the compiler (after ‘-cargs’ or in package
     Compiler of the project file), ‘gnatmake’ will fail because it will
     not find the object file after compilation.  If ‘gnatmake’ is
     called with ‘-gnatc’ as a builder switch (before ‘-cargs’ or in
     package Builder of the project file) then ‘gnatmake’ will not fail
     because it will not look for the object files after compilation,
     and it will not try to build and link.

‘-gnatC’

     Generate CodePeer intermediate format (no code generation
     attempted).  This switch will generate an intermediate
     representation suitable for use by CodePeer (‘.scil’ files).  This
     switch is not compatible with code generation (it will, among other
     things, disable some switches such as ‘-gnatn’, and enable others
     such as ‘-gnata’).

‘-gnatd’

     Specify debug options for the compiler.  The string of characters
     after the ‘-gnatd’ specifies the specific debug options.  The
     possible characters are 0-9, a-z, A-Z, optionally preceded by a dot
     or underscore.  See compiler source file ‘debug.adb’ for details of
     the implemented debug options.  Certain debug options are relevant
     to application programmers, and these are documented at appropriate
     points in this user’s guide.

‘-gnatD’

     Create expanded source files for source level debugging.  This
     switch also suppresses generation of cross-reference information
     (see ‘-gnatx’).  Note that this switch is not allowed if a previous
     ‘-gnatR’ switch has been given, since these two switches are not
     compatible.

‘-gnateA’

     Check that the actual parameters of a subprogram call are not
     aliases of one another.  To qualify as aliasing, their memory
     locations must be identical or overlapping, at least one of the
     corresponding formal parameters must be of mode OUT or IN OUT, and
     at least one of the corresponding formal parameters must have its
     parameter passing mechanism not specified.

          type Rec_Typ is record
             Data : Integer := 0;
          end record;

          function Self (Val : Rec_Typ) return Rec_Typ is
          begin
             return Val;
          end Self;

          procedure Detect_Aliasing (Val_1 : in out Rec_Typ; Val_2 : Rec_Typ) is
          begin
             null;
          end Detect_Aliasing;

          Obj : Rec_Typ;

          Detect_Aliasing (Obj, Obj);
          Detect_Aliasing (Obj, Self (Obj));

     In the example above, the first call to ‘Detect_Aliasing’ fails
     with a ‘Program_Error’ at run time because the actuals for ‘Val_1’
     and ‘Val_2’ denote the same object.  The second call executes
     without raising an exception because ‘Self(Obj)’ produces an
     anonymous object which does not share the memory location of ‘Obj’.

‘-gnateb’

     Store configuration files by their basename in ALI files.  This
     switch is used for instance by gprbuild for distributed builds in
     order to prevent issues where machine-specific absolute paths could
     end up being stored in ALI files.

‘-gnatec=`path'’

     Specify a configuration pragma file (the equal sign is optional)
     (*note The Configuration Pragmas Files: 63.).

‘-gnateC’

     Generate CodePeer messages in a compiler-like format.  This switch
     is only effective if ‘-gnatcC’ is also specified and requires an
     installation of CodePeer.

‘-gnated’

     Disable atomic synchronization

‘-gnateDsymbol[=`value']’

     Defines a symbol, associated with ‘value’, for preprocessing.
     (*note Integrated Preprocessing: 91.).

‘-gnateE’

     Generate extra information in exception messages.  In particular,
     display extra column information and the value and range associated
     with index and range check failures, and extra column information
     for access checks.  In cases where the compiler is able to
     determine at compile time that a check will fail, it gives a
     warning, and the extra information is not produced at run time.

‘-gnatef’

     Display full source path name in brief error messages and absolute
     paths in ‘-fdiagnostics-format=json’’s output.

‘-gnateF’

     Check for overflow on all floating-point operations, including
     those for unconstrained predefined types.  See description of
     pragma ‘Check_Float_Overflow’ in GNAT RM.

‘-gnateg’ ‘-gnatceg’

     The ‘-gnatc’ switch must always be specified before this switch,
     e.g.  ‘-gnatceg’.  Generate a C header from the Ada input file.
     See *note Generating C Headers for Ada Specifications: b9. for more
     information.

‘-gnateG’

     Save result of preprocessing in a text file.

‘-gnateH’

     Set the threshold from which the RM 13.5.1(13.3/2) clause applies
     to 64.  This is useful only on 64-bit plaforms where this threshold
     is 128, but used to be 64 in earlier versions of the compiler.

‘-gnatei`nnn'’

     Set maximum number of instantiations during compilation of a single
     unit to ‘nnn’.  This may be useful in increasing the default
     maximum of 8000 for the rare case when a single unit legitimately
     exceeds this limit.

‘-gnateI`nnn'’

     Indicates that the source is a multi-unit source and that the index
     of the unit to compile is ‘nnn’.  ‘nnn’ needs to be a positive
     number and need to be a valid index in the multi-unit source.

‘-gnatel’

     This switch can be used with the static elaboration model to issue
     info messages showing where implicit ‘pragma Elaborate’ and ‘pragma
     Elaborate_All’ are generated.  This is useful in diagnosing
     elaboration circularities caused by these implicit pragmas when
     using the static elaboration model.  See the section in this guide
     on elaboration checking for further details.  These messages are
     not generated by default, and are intended only for temporary use
     when debugging circularity problems.

‘-gnateL’

     This switch turns off the info messages about implicit elaboration
     pragmas.

‘-gnatem=`path'’

     Specify a mapping file (the equal sign is optional) (*note Units to
     Sources Mapping Files: ea.).

‘-gnatep=`file'’

     Specify a preprocessing data file (the equal sign is optional)
     (*note Integrated Preprocessing: 91.).

‘-gnateP’

     Turn categorization dependency errors into warnings.  Ada requires
     that units that WITH one another have compatible categories, for
     example a Pure unit cannot WITH a Preelaborate unit.  If this
     switch is used, these errors become warnings (which can be ignored,
     or suppressed in the usual manner).  This can be useful in some
     specialized circumstances such as the temporary use of special test
     software.

‘-gnateS’

     Synonym of ‘-fdump-scos’, kept for backwards compatibility.

‘-gnatet=`path'’

     Generate target dependent information.  The format of the output
     file is described in the section about switch ‘-gnateT’.

‘-gnateT=`path'’

     Read target dependent information, such as endianness or sizes and
     alignments of base type.  If this switch is passed, the default
     target dependent information of the compiler is replaced by the one
     read from the input file.  This is used by tools other than the
     compiler, e.g.  to do semantic analysis of programs that will run
     on some other target than the machine on which the tool is run.

     The following target dependent values should be defined, where
     ‘Nat’ denotes a natural integer value, ‘Pos’ denotes a positive
     integer value, and fields marked with a question mark are boolean
     fields, where a value of 0 is False, and a value of 1 is True:

          Bits_BE                    : Nat; -- Bits stored big-endian?
          Bits_Per_Unit              : Pos; -- Bits in a storage unit
          Bits_Per_Word              : Pos; -- Bits in a word
          Bytes_BE                   : Nat; -- Bytes stored big-endian?
          Char_Size                  : Pos; -- Standard.Character'Size
          Double_Float_Alignment     : Nat; -- Alignment of double float
          Double_Scalar_Alignment    : Nat; -- Alignment of double length scalar
          Double_Size                : Pos; -- Standard.Long_Float'Size
          Float_Size                 : Pos; -- Standard.Float'Size
          Float_Words_BE             : Nat; -- Float words stored big-endian?
          Int_Size                   : Pos; -- Standard.Integer'Size
          Long_Double_Size           : Pos; -- Standard.Long_Long_Float'Size
          Long_Long_Long_Size        : Pos; -- Standard.Long_Long_Long_Integer'Size
          Long_Long_Size             : Pos; -- Standard.Long_Long_Integer'Size
          Long_Size                  : Pos; -- Standard.Long_Integer'Size
          Maximum_Alignment          : Pos; -- Maximum permitted alignment
          Max_Unaligned_Field        : Pos; -- Maximum size for unaligned bit field
          Pointer_Size               : Pos; -- System.Address'Size
          Short_Enums                : Nat; -- Foreign enums use short size?
          Short_Size                 : Pos; -- Standard.Short_Integer'Size
          Strict_Alignment           : Nat; -- Strict alignment?
          System_Allocator_Alignment : Nat; -- Alignment for malloc calls
          Wchar_T_Size               : Pos; -- Interfaces.C.wchar_t'Size
          Words_BE                   : Nat; -- Words stored big-endian?

     ‘Bits_Per_Unit’ is the number of bits in a storage unit, the
     equivalent of GCC macro ‘BITS_PER_UNIT’ documented as follows:
     ‘Define this macro to be the number of bits in an addressable
     storage unit (byte); normally 8.’

     ‘Bits_Per_Word’ is the number of bits in a machine word, the
     equivalent of GCC macro ‘BITS_PER_WORD’ documented as follows:
     ‘Number of bits in a word; normally 32.’

     ‘Double_Float_Alignment’, if not zero, is the maximum alignment
     that the compiler can choose by default for a 64-bit floating-point
     type or object.

     ‘Double_Scalar_Alignment’, if not zero, is the maximum alignment
     that the compiler can choose by default for a 64-bit or larger
     scalar type or object.

     ‘Maximum_Alignment’ is the maximum alignment that the compiler can
     choose by default for a type or object, which is also the maximum
     alignment that can be specified in GNAT. It is computed for GCC
     backends as ‘BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT / BITS_PER_UNIT’ where GCC macro
     ‘BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT’ is documented as follows: ‘Biggest alignment
     that any data type can require on this machine, in bits.’

     ‘Max_Unaligned_Field’ is the maximum size for unaligned bit field,
     which is 64 for the majority of GCC targets (but can be different
     on some targets).

     ‘Strict_Alignment’ is the equivalent of GCC macro
     ‘STRICT_ALIGNMENT’ documented as follows: ‘Define this macro to be
     the value 1 if instructions will fail to work if given data not on
     the nominal alignment. If instructions will merely go slower in
     that case, define this macro as 0.’

     ‘System_Allocator_Alignment’ is the guaranteed alignment of data
     returned by calls to ‘malloc’.

     The format of the input file is as follows.  First come the values
     of the variables defined above, with one line per value:

          name  value

     where ‘name’ is the name of the parameter, spelled out in full, and
     cased as in the above list, and ‘value’ is an unsigned decimal
     integer.  Two or more blanks separates the name from the value.

     All the variables must be present, in alphabetical order (i.e.  the
     same order as the list above).

     Then there is a blank line to separate the two parts of the file.
     Then come the lines showing the floating-point types to be
     registered, with one line per registered mode:

          name  digs float_rep size alignment

     where ‘name’ is the string name of the type (which can have single
     spaces embedded in the name, e.g.  long double), ‘digs’ is the
     number of digits for the floating-point type, ‘float_rep’ is the
     float representation (I for IEEE-754-Binary, which is the only one
     supported at this time), ‘size’ is the size in bits, ‘alignment’ is
     the alignment in bits.  The name is followed by at least two
     blanks, fields are separated by at least one blank, and a LF
     character immediately follows the alignment field.

     Here is an example of a target parameterization file:

          Bits_BE                       0
          Bits_Per_Unit                 8
          Bits_Per_Word                64
          Bytes_BE                      0
          Char_Size                     8
          Double_Float_Alignment        0
          Double_Scalar_Alignment       0
          Double_Size                  64
          Float_Size                   32
          Float_Words_BE                0
          Int_Size                     64
          Long_Double_Size            128
          Long_Long_Long_Size         128
          Long_Long_Size               64
          Long_Size                    64
          Maximum_Alignment            16
          Max_Unaligned_Field          64
          Pointer_Size                 64
          Short_Size                   16
          Strict_Alignment              0
          System_Allocator_Alignment   16
          Wchar_T_Size                 32
          Words_BE                      0

          float         15  I  64  64
          double        15  I  64  64
          long double   18  I  80 128
          TF            33  I 128 128

‘-gnateu’

     Ignore unrecognized validity, warning, and style switches that
     appear after this switch is given.  This may be useful when
     compiling sources developed on a later version of the compiler with
     an earlier version.  Of course the earlier version must support
     this switch.

‘-gnateV’

     Check that all actual parameters of a subprogram call are valid
     according to the rules of validity checking (*note Validity
     Checking: e9.).

‘-gnateY’

     Ignore all STYLE_CHECKS pragmas.  Full legality checks are still
     carried out, but the pragmas have no effect on what style checks
     are active.  This allows all style checking options to be
     controlled from the command line.

‘-gnatE’

     Dynamic elaboration checking mode enabled.  For further details see
     *note Elaboration Order Handling in GNAT: f.

‘-gnatf’

     Full errors.  Multiple errors per line, all undefined references,
     do not attempt to suppress cascaded errors.

‘-gnatF’

     Externals names are folded to all uppercase.

‘-gnatg’

     Internal GNAT implementation mode.  This should not be used for
     applications programs, it is intended only for use by the compiler
     and its run-time library.  For documentation, see the GNAT sources.
     Note that ‘-gnatg’ implies ‘-gnatw.ge’ and ‘-gnatyg’ so that all
     standard warnings and all standard style options are turned on.
     All warnings and style messages are treated as errors.

‘-gnatG=nn’

     List generated expanded code in source form.

‘-gnath’

     Output usage information.  The output is written to ‘stdout’.

‘-gnatH’

     Legacy elaboration-checking mode enabled.  When this switch is in
     effect, the pre-18.x access-before-elaboration model becomes the de
     facto model.  For further details see *note Elaboration Order
     Handling in GNAT: f.

‘-gnati`c'’

     Identifier character set (‘c’ = 1/2/3/4/5/9/p/8/f/n/w).  For
     details of the possible selections for ‘c’, see *note Character Set
     Control: 31.

‘-gnatI’

     Ignore representation clauses.  When this switch is used,
     representation clauses are treated as comments.  This is useful
     when initially porting code where you want to ignore rep clause
     problems, and also for compiling foreign code (particularly for use
     with ASIS). The representation clauses that are ignored are:
     enumeration_representation_clause, record_representation_clause,
     and attribute_definition_clause for the following attributes:
     Address, Alignment, Bit_Order, Component_Size, Machine_Radix,
     Object_Size, Scalar_Storage_Order, Size, Small, Stream_Size, and
     Value_Size.  Pragma Default_Scalar_Storage_Order is also ignored.
     Note that this option should be used only for compiling – the code
     is likely to malfunction at run time.

‘-gnatj`nn'’

     Reformat error messages to fit on ‘nn’ character lines

‘-gnatJ’

     Permissive elaboration-checking mode enabled.  When this switch is
     in effect, the post-18.x access-before-elaboration model ignores
     potential issues with:

        - Accept statements

        - Activations of tasks defined in instances

        - Assertion pragmas

        - Calls from within an instance to its enclosing context

        - Calls through generic formal parameters

        - Calls to subprograms defined in instances

        - Entry calls

        - Indirect calls using ‘Access

        - Requeue statements

        - Select statements

        - Synchronous task suspension

     and does not emit compile-time diagnostics or run-time checks.  For
     further details see *note Elaboration Order Handling in GNAT: f.

‘-gnatk=`n'’

     Limit file names to ‘n’ (1-999) characters (‘k’ = krunch).

‘-gnatl’

     Output full source listing with embedded error messages.

‘-gnatL’

     Used in conjunction with -gnatG or -gnatD to intersperse original
     source lines (as comment lines with line numbers) in the expanded
     source output.

‘-gnatm=`n'’

     Limit number of detected error or warning messages to ‘n’ where ‘n’
     is in the range 1..999999.  The default setting if no switch is
     given is 9999.  If the number of warnings reaches this limit, then
     a message is output and further warnings are suppressed, but the
     compilation is continued.  If the number of error messages reaches
     this limit, then a message is output and the compilation is
     abandoned.  The equal sign here is optional.  A value of zero means
     that no limit applies.

‘-gnatn[12]’

     Activate inlining across units for subprograms for which pragma
     ‘Inline’ is specified.  This inlining is performed by the GCC
     back-end.  An optional digit sets the inlining level: 1 for
     moderate inlining across units or 2 for full inlining across units.
     If no inlining level is specified, the compiler will pick it based
     on the optimization level.

‘-gnatN’

     Activate front end inlining for subprograms for which pragma
     ‘Inline’ is specified.  This inlining is performed by the front end
     and will be visible in the ‘-gnatG’ output.

     When using a gcc-based back end, then the use of ‘-gnatN’ is
     deprecated, and the use of ‘-gnatn’ is preferred.  Historically
     front end inlining was more extensive than the gcc back end
     inlining, but that is no longer the case.

‘-gnato0’

     Suppresses overflow checking.  This causes the behavior of the
     compiler to match the default for older versions where overflow
     checking was suppressed by default.  This is equivalent to having
     ‘pragma Suppress (Overflow_Check)’ in a configuration pragma file.

‘-gnato??’

     Set default mode for handling generation of code to avoid
     intermediate arithmetic overflow.  Here ‘??’ is two digits, a
     single digit, or nothing.  Each digit is one of the digits ‘1’
     through ‘3’:

     Digit     Interpretation
               
               
     ‘1’       All intermediate overflows checked against base type (‘STRICT’)
               
               
     ‘2’       Minimize intermediate overflows (‘MINIMIZED’)
               
               
     ‘3’       Eliminate intermediate overflows (‘ELIMINATED’)
               

     If only one digit appears, then it applies to all cases; if two
     digits are given, then the first applies outside assertions,
     pre/postconditions, and type invariants, and the second applies
     within assertions, pre/postconditions, and type invariants.

     If no digits follow the ‘-gnato’, then it is equivalent to
     ‘-gnato11’, causing all intermediate overflows to be handled in
     strict mode.

     This switch also causes arithmetic overflow checking to be
     performed (as though ‘pragma Unsuppress (Overflow_Check)’ had been
     specified).

     The default if no option ‘-gnato’ is given is that overflow
     handling is in ‘STRICT’ mode (computations done using the base
     type), and that overflow checking is enabled.

     Note that division by zero is a separate check that is not
     controlled by this switch (divide-by-zero checking is on by
     default).

     See also *note Specifying the Desired Mode: eb.

‘-gnatp’

     Suppress all checks.  See *note Run-Time Checks: ec. for details.
     This switch has no effect if cancelled by a subsequent ‘-gnat-p’
     switch.

‘-gnat-p’

     Cancel effect of previous ‘-gnatp’ switch.

‘-gnatq’

     Don’t quit.  Try semantics, even if parse errors.

‘-gnatQ’

     Don’t quit.  Generate ‘ALI’ and tree files even if illegalities.
     Note that code generation is still suppressed in the presence of
     any errors, so even with ‘-gnatQ’ no object file is generated.

‘-gnatr’

     Treat pragma Restrictions as Restriction_Warnings.

‘-gnatR[0|1|2|3|4][e][j][m][s]’

     Output representation information for declared types, objects and
     subprograms.  Note that this switch is not allowed if a previous
     ‘-gnatD’ switch has been given, since these two switches are not
     compatible.

‘-gnats’

     Syntax check only.

‘-gnatS’

     Print package Standard.

‘-gnatT`nnn'’

     All compiler tables start at ‘nnn’ times usual starting size.

‘-gnatu’

     List units for this compilation.

‘-gnatU’

     Tag all error messages with the unique string ‘error:’

‘-gnatv’

     Verbose mode.  Full error output with source lines to ‘stdout’.

‘-gnatV’

     Control level of validity checking (*note Validity Checking: e9.).

‘-gnatw`xxx'’

     Warning mode where ‘xxx’ is a string of option letters that denotes
     the exact warnings that are enabled or disabled (*note Warning
     Message Control: ed.).

‘-gnatW`e'’

     Wide character encoding method (‘e’=n/h/u/s/e/8).

‘-gnatx’

     Suppress generation of cross-reference information.

‘-gnatX’

     Enable core GNAT implementation extensions and latest Ada version.

‘-gnatX0’

     Enable all GNAT implementation extensions and latest Ada version.

‘-gnaty’

     Enable built-in style checks (*note Style Checking: ee.).

‘-gnatz`m'’

     Distribution stub generation and compilation (‘m’=r/c for
     receiver/caller stubs).

‘-I`dir'’

     Direct GNAT to search the ‘dir’ directory for source files needed
     by the current compilation (see *note Search Paths and the Run-Time
     Library (RTL): 73.).

‘-I-’

     Except for the source file named in the command line, do not look
     for source files in the directory containing the source file named
     in the command line (see *note Search Paths and the Run-Time
     Library (RTL): 73.).

‘-o `file'’

     This switch is used in ‘gcc’ to redirect the generated object file
     and its associated ALI file.  Beware of this switch with GNAT,
     because it may cause the object file and ALI file to have different
     names which in turn may confuse the binder and the linker.

‘-nostdinc’

     Inhibit the search of the default location for the GNAT Run Time
     Library (RTL) source files.

‘-nostdlib’

     Inhibit the search of the default location for the GNAT Run Time
     Library (RTL) ALI files.

‘-O[`n']’

     ‘n’ controls the optimization level:

     ‘n’         Effect
                 
                 
     ‘0’         No optimization, the default setting if no ‘-O’ appears
                 
                 
     ‘1’         Normal optimization, the default if you specify ‘-O’ without an operand.
                 A good compromise between code quality and compilation time.
                 
                 
     ‘2’         Extensive optimization, may improve execution time, possibly at the cost
                 of substantially increased compilation time.
                 
                 
     ‘3’         Same as ‘-O2’, and also includes inline expansion for small subprograms in
                 the same unit.
                 
                 
     ‘s’         Optimize space usage
                 

     See also *note Optimization Levels: ef.

‘-pass-exit-codes’

     Catch exit codes from the compiler and use the most meaningful as
     exit status.

‘--RTS=`rts-path'’

     Specifies the default location of the run-time library.  Same
     meaning as the equivalent ‘gnatmake’ flag (*note Switches for
     gnatmake: d0.).

‘-S’

     Used in place of ‘-c’ to cause the assembler source file to be
     generated, using ‘.s’ as the extension, instead of the object file.
     This may be useful if you need to examine the generated assembly
     code.

‘-fverbose-asm’

     Used in conjunction with ‘-S’ to cause the generated assembly code
     file to be annotated with variable names, making it significantly
     easier to follow.

‘-v’

     Show commands generated by the ‘gcc’ driver.  Normally used only
     for debugging purposes or if you need to be sure what version of
     the compiler you are executing.

‘-V `ver'’

     Execute ‘ver’ version of the compiler.  This is the ‘gcc’ version,
     not the GNAT version.

‘-w’

     Turn off warnings generated by the back end of the compiler.  Use
     of this switch also causes the default for front end warnings to be
     set to suppress (as though ‘-gnatws’ had appeared at the start of
     the options).

You may combine a sequence of GNAT switches into a single switch.  For
example, the combined switch

          -gnatofi3

is equivalent to specifying the following sequence of switches:

          -gnato -gnatf -gnati3

The following restrictions apply to the combination of switches in this
manner:

   * The switch ‘-gnatc’ if combined with other switches must come first
     in the string.

   * The switch ‘-gnats’ if combined with other switches must come first
     in the string.

   * The switches ‘-gnatzc’ and ‘-gnatzr’ may not be combined with any
     other switches, and only one of them may appear in the command
     line.

   * The switch ‘-gnat-p’ may not be combined with any other switch.

   * Once a ‘y’ appears in the string (that is a use of the ‘-gnaty’
     switch), then all further characters in the switch are interpreted
     as style modifiers (see description of ‘-gnaty’).

   * Once a ‘d’ appears in the string (that is a use of the ‘-gnatd’
     switch), then all further characters in the switch are interpreted
     as debug flags (see description of ‘-gnatd’).

   * Once a ‘w’ appears in the string (that is a use of the ‘-gnatw’
     switch), then all further characters in the switch are interpreted
     as warning mode modifiers (see description of ‘-gnatw’).

   * Once a ‘V’ appears in the string (that is a use of the ‘-gnatV’
     switch), then all further characters in the switch are interpreted
     as validity checking options (*note Validity Checking: e9.).

   * Option ‘em’, ‘ec’, ‘ep’, ‘l=’ and ‘R’ must be the last options in a
     combined list of options.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Output and Error Message Control,  Next: Warning Message Control,  Prev: Alphabetical List of All Switches,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.2 Output and Error Message Control
--------------------------------------

The standard default format for error messages is called ‘brief format’.
Brief format messages are written to ‘stderr’ (the standard error file)
and have the following form:

     e.adb:3:04: Incorrect spelling of keyword "function"
     e.adb:4:20: ";" should be "is"

The first integer after the file name is the line number in the file,
and the second integer is the column number within the line.  ‘GNAT
Studio’ can parse the error messages and point to the referenced
character.  The following switches provide control over the error
message format:

‘-gnatv’

     The ‘v’ stands for verbose.  The effect of this setting is to write
     long-format error messages to ‘stdout’ (the standard output file).
     The same program compiled with the ‘-gnatv’ switch would generate:

          3. funcion X (Q : Integer)
             |
          >>> Incorrect spelling of keyword "function"
          4. return Integer;
                           |
          >>> ";" should be "is"

     The vertical bar indicates the location of the error, and the ‘>>>’
     prefix can be used to search for error messages.  When this switch
     is used the only source lines output are those with errors.

‘-gnatl’

     The ‘l’ stands for list.  This switch causes a full listing of the
     file to be generated.  In the case where a body is compiled, the
     corresponding spec is also listed, along with any subunits.
     Typical output from compiling a package body ‘p.adb’ might look
     like:

          Compiling: p.adb

               1. package body p is
               2.    procedure a;
               3.    procedure a is separate;
               4. begin
               5.    null
                         |
                  >>> missing ";"

               6. end;

          Compiling: p.ads

               1. package p is
               2.    pragma Elaborate_Body
                                          |
                  >>> missing ";"

               3. end p;

          Compiling: p-a.adb

               1. separate p
                          |
                  >>> missing "("

               2. procedure a is
               3. begin
               4.    null
                         |
                  >>> missing ";"

               5. end;

     When you specify the ‘-gnatv’ or ‘-gnatl’ switches and standard
     output is redirected, a brief summary is written to ‘stderr’
     (standard error) giving the number of error messages and warning
     messages generated.

‘-gnatl=`fname'’

     This has the same effect as ‘-gnatl’ except that the output is
     written to a file instead of to standard output.  If the given name
     ‘fname’ does not start with a period, then it is the full name of
     the file to be written.  If ‘fname’ is an extension, it is appended
     to the name of the file being compiled.  For example, if file
     ‘xyz.adb’ is compiled with ‘-gnatl=.lst’, then the output is
     written to file xyz.adb.lst.

‘-gnatU’

     This switch forces all error messages to be preceded by the unique
     string ‘error:’.  This means that error messages take a few more
     characters in space, but allows easy searching for and
     identification of error messages.

‘-gnatb’

     The ‘b’ stands for brief.  This switch causes GNAT to generate the
     brief format error messages to ‘stderr’ (the standard error file)
     as well as the verbose format message or full listing (which as
     usual is written to ‘stdout’, the standard output file).

‘-gnatm=`n'’

     The ‘m’ stands for maximum.  ‘n’ is a decimal integer in the range
     of 1 to 999999 and limits the number of error or warning messages
     to be generated.  For example, using ‘-gnatm2’ might yield

          e.adb:3:04: Incorrect spelling of keyword "function"
          e.adb:5:35: missing ".."
          fatal error: maximum number of errors detected
          compilation abandoned

     The default setting if no switch is given is 9999.  If the number
     of warnings reaches this limit, then a message is output and
     further warnings are suppressed, but the compilation is continued.
     If the number of error messages reaches this limit, then a message
     is output and the compilation is abandoned.  A value of zero means
     that no limit applies.

     Note that the equal sign is optional, so the switches ‘-gnatm2’ and
     ‘-gnatm=2’ are equivalent.

‘-gnatf’

     The ‘f’ stands for full.  Normally, the compiler suppresses error
     messages that are likely to be redundant.  This switch causes all
     error messages to be generated.  In particular, in the case of
     references to undefined variables.  If a given variable is
     referenced several times, the normal format of messages is

          e.adb:7:07: "V" is undefined (more references follow)

     where the parenthetical comment warns that there are additional
     references to the variable ‘V’.  Compiling the same program with
     the ‘-gnatf’ switch yields

          e.adb:7:07: "V" is undefined
          e.adb:8:07: "V" is undefined
          e.adb:8:12: "V" is undefined
          e.adb:8:16: "V" is undefined
          e.adb:9:07: "V" is undefined
          e.adb:9:12: "V" is undefined

     The ‘-gnatf’ switch also generates additional information for some
     error messages.  Some examples are:

        * Details on possibly non-portable unchecked conversion

        * List possible interpretations for ambiguous calls

        * Additional details on incorrect parameters

‘-gnatjnn’

     In normal operation mode (or if ‘-gnatj0’ is used), then error
     messages with continuation lines are treated as though the
     continuation lines were separate messages (and so a warning with
     two continuation lines counts as three warnings, and is listed as
     three separate messages).

     If the ‘-gnatjnn’ switch is used with a positive value for nn, then
     messages are output in a different manner.  A message and all its
     continuation lines are treated as a unit, and count as only one
     warning or message in the statistics totals.  Furthermore, the
     message is reformatted so that no line is longer than nn
     characters.

‘-gnatq’

     The ‘q’ stands for quit (really ‘don’t quit’).  In normal operation
     mode, the compiler first parses the program and determines if there
     are any syntax errors.  If there are, appropriate error messages
     are generated and compilation is immediately terminated.  This
     switch tells GNAT to continue with semantic analysis even if syntax
     errors have been found.  This may enable the detection of more
     errors in a single run.  On the other hand, the semantic analyzer
     is more likely to encounter some internal fatal error when given a
     syntactically invalid tree.

‘-gnatQ’

     In normal operation mode, the ‘ALI’ file is not generated if any
     illegalities are detected in the program.  The use of ‘-gnatQ’
     forces generation of the ‘ALI’ file.  This file is marked as being
     in error, so it cannot be used for binding purposes, but it does
     contain reasonably complete cross-reference information, and thus
     may be useful for use by tools (e.g., semantic browsing tools or
     integrated development environments) that are driven from the ‘ALI’
     file.  This switch implies ‘-gnatq’, since the semantic phase must
     be run to get a meaningful ALI file.

     When ‘-gnatQ’ is used and the generated ‘ALI’ file is marked as
     being in error, ‘gnatmake’ will attempt to recompile the source
     when it finds such an ‘ALI’ file, including with switch ‘-gnatc’.

     Note that ‘-gnatQ’ has no effect if ‘-gnats’ is specified, since
     ALI files are never generated if ‘-gnats’ is set.

4.3.3 Warning Message Control
-----------------------------

In addition to error messages, which correspond to illegalities as
defined in the Ada Reference Manual, the compiler detects two kinds of
warning situations.

First, the compiler considers some constructs suspicious and generates a
warning message to alert you to a possible error.  Second, if the
compiler detects a situation that is sure to raise an exception at run
time, it generates a warning message.  The following shows an example of
warning messages:

     e.adb:4:24: warning: creation of object may raise Storage_Error
     e.adb:10:17: warning: static value out of range
     e.adb:10:17: warning: "Constraint_Error" will be raised at run time

GNAT considers a large number of situations as appropriate for the
generation of warning messages.  As always, warnings are not definite
indications of errors.  For example, if you do an out-of-range
assignment with the deliberate intention of raising a ‘Constraint_Error’
exception, then the warning that may be issued does not indicate an
error.  Some of the situations for which GNAT issues warnings (at least
some of the time) are given in the following list.  This list is not
complete, and new warnings are often added to subsequent versions of
GNAT. The list is intended to give a general idea of the kinds of
warnings that are generated.

   * Possible infinitely recursive calls

   * Out-of-range values being assigned

   * Possible order of elaboration problems

   * Size not a multiple of alignment for a record type

   * Assertions (pragma Assert) that are sure to fail

   * Unreachable code

   * Address clauses with possibly unaligned values, or where an attempt
     is made to overlay a smaller variable with a larger one.

   * Fixed-point type declarations with a null range

   * Direct_IO or Sequential_IO instantiated with a type that has access
     values

   * Variables that are never assigned a value

   * Variables that are referenced before being initialized

   * Task entries with no corresponding ‘accept’ statement

   * Duplicate accepts for the same task entry in a ‘select’

   * Objects that take too much storage

   * Unchecked conversion between types of differing sizes

   * Missing ‘return’ statement along some execution path in a function

   * Incorrect (unrecognized) pragmas

   * Incorrect external names

   * Allocation from empty storage pool

   * Potentially blocking operation in protected type

   * Suspicious parenthesization of expressions

   * Mismatching bounds in an aggregate

   * Attempt to return local value by reference

   * Premature instantiation of a generic body

   * Attempt to pack aliased components

   * Out of bounds array subscripts

   * Wrong length on string assignment

   * Violations of style rules if style checking is enabled

   * Unused ‘with’ clauses

   * ‘Bit_Order’ usage that does not have any effect

   * ‘Standard.Duration’ used to resolve universal fixed expression

   * Dereference of possibly null value

   * Declaration that is likely to cause storage error

   * Internal GNAT unit ‘with’ed by application unit

   * Values known to be out of range at compile time

   * Unreferenced or unmodified variables.  Note that a special
     exemption applies to variables which contain any of the substrings
     ‘DISCARD, DUMMY, IGNORE, JUNK, UNUSED’, in any casing.  Such
     variables are considered likely to be intentionally used in a
     situation where otherwise a warning would be given, so warnings of
     this kind are always suppressed for such variables.

   * Address overlays that could clobber memory

   * Unexpected initialization when address clause present

   * Bad alignment for address clause

   * Useless type conversions

   * Redundant assignment statements and other redundant constructs

   * Useless exception handlers

   * Accidental hiding of name by child unit

   * Access before elaboration detected at compile time

   * A range in a ‘for’ loop that is known to be null or might be null

The following section lists compiler switches that are available to
control the handling of warning messages.  It is also possible to
exercise much finer control over what warnings are issued and suppressed
using the GNAT pragma Warnings (see the description of the pragma in the
‘GNAT_Reference_manual’).

‘-gnatwa’

     ‘Activate most optional warnings.’

     This switch activates most optional warning messages.  See the
     remaining list in this section for details on optional warning
     messages that can be individually controlled.  The warnings that
     are not turned on by this switch are:

        * ‘-gnatwd’ (implicit dereferencing)

        * ‘-gnatw.d’ (tag warnings with -gnatw switch)

        * ‘-gnatwh’ (hiding)

        * ‘-gnatw.h’ (holes in record layouts)

        * ‘-gnatw.j’ (late primitives of tagged types)

        * ‘-gnatw.k’ (redefinition of names in standard)

        * ‘-gnatwl’ (elaboration warnings)

        * ‘-gnatw.l’ (inherited aspects)

        * ‘-gnatw.n’ (atomic synchronization)

        * ‘-gnatwo’ (address clause overlay)

        * ‘-gnatw.o’ (values set by out parameters ignored)

        * ‘-gnatw.q’ (questionable layout of record types)

        * ‘-gnatw_q’ (ignored equality)

        * ‘-gnatw_r’ (out-of-order record representation clauses)

        * ‘-gnatw.s’ (overridden size clause)

        * ‘-gnatw_s’ (ineffective predicate test)

        * ‘-gnatwt’ (tracking of deleted conditional code)

        * ‘-gnatw.u’ (unordered enumeration)

        * ‘-gnatw.w’ (use of Warnings Off)

        * ‘-gnatw.y’ (reasons for package needing body)

     All other optional warnings are turned on.

‘-gnatwA’

     ‘Suppress all optional errors.’

     This switch suppresses all optional warning messages, see remaining
     list in this section for details on optional warning messages that
     can be individually controlled.  Note that unlike switch ‘-gnatws’,
     the use of switch ‘-gnatwA’ does not suppress warnings that are
     normally given unconditionally and cannot be individually
     controlled (for example, the warning about a missing exit path in a
     function).  Also, again unlike switch ‘-gnatws’, warnings
     suppressed by the use of switch ‘-gnatwA’ can be individually
     turned back on.  For example the use of switch ‘-gnatwA’ followed
     by switch ‘-gnatwd’ will suppress all optional warnings except the
     warnings for implicit dereferencing.

‘-gnatw.a’

     ‘Activate warnings on failing assertions.’

     This switch activates warnings for assertions where the compiler
     can tell at compile time that the assertion will fail.  Note that
     this warning is given even if assertions are disabled.  The default
     is that such warnings are generated.

‘-gnatw.A’

     ‘Suppress warnings on failing assertions.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for assertions where the compiler
     can tell at compile time that the assertion will fail.

‘-gnatw_a’

     ‘Activate warnings on anonymous allocators.’

     This switch activates warnings for allocators of anonymous access
     types, which can involve run-time accessibility checks and lead to
     unexpected accessibility violations.  For more details on the rules
     involved, see RM 3.10.2 (14).

‘-gnatw_A’

     ‘Suppress warnings on anonymous allocators.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for anonymous access type
     allocators.

‘-gnatwb’

     ‘Activate warnings on bad fixed values.’

     This switch activates warnings for static fixed-point expressions
     whose value is not an exact multiple of Small.  Such values are
     implementation dependent, since an implementation is free to choose
     either of the multiples that surround the value.  GNAT always
     chooses the closer one, but this is not required behavior, and it
     is better to specify a value that is an exact multiple, ensuring
     predictable execution.  The default is that such warnings are not
     generated.

‘-gnatwB’

     ‘Suppress warnings on bad fixed values.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for static fixed-point expressions
     whose value is not an exact multiple of Small.

‘-gnatw.b’

     ‘Activate warnings on biased representation.’

     This switch activates warnings when a size clause, value size
     clause, component clause, or component size clause forces the use
     of biased representation for an integer type (e.g.  representing a
     range of 10..11 in a single bit by using 0/1 to represent 10/11).
     The default is that such warnings are generated.

‘-gnatw.B’

     ‘Suppress warnings on biased representation.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for representation clauses that
     force the use of biased representation.

‘-gnatwc’

     ‘Activate warnings on conditionals.’

     This switch activates warnings for boolean expressions that are
     known to be True or False at compile time.  The default is that
     such warnings are not generated.  Note that this warning does not
     get issued for the use of boolean constants whose values are known
     at compile time, since this is a standard technique for conditional
     compilation in Ada, and this would generate too many false positive
     warnings.

     This warning option also activates a special test for comparisons
     using the operators ‘>=’ and’ <=’.  If the compiler can tell that
     only the equality condition is possible, then it will warn that the
     ‘>’ or ‘<’ part of the test is useless and that the operator could
     be replaced by ‘=’.  An example would be comparing a ‘Natural’
     variable <= 0.

     This warning option also generates warnings if one or both tests is
     optimized away in a membership test for integer values if the
     result can be determined at compile time.  Range tests on
     enumeration types are not included, since it is common for such
     tests to include an end point.

     This warning can also be turned on using ‘-gnatwa’.

‘-gnatwC’

     ‘Suppress warnings on conditionals.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for conditional expressions used in
     tests that are known to be True or False at compile time.

‘-gnatw.c’

     ‘Activate warnings on missing component clauses.’

     This switch activates warnings for record components where a record
     representation clause is present and has component clauses for the
     majority, but not all, of the components.  A warning is given for
     each component for which no component clause is present.

‘-gnatw.C’

     ‘Suppress warnings on missing component clauses.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for record components that are
     missing a component clause in the situation described above.

‘-gnatw_c’

     ‘Activate warnings on unknown condition in Compile_Time_Warning.’

     This switch activates warnings on a pragma Compile_Time_Warning or
     Compile_Time_Error whose condition has a value that is not known at
     compile time.  The default is that such warnings are generated.

‘-gnatw_C’

     ‘Suppress warnings on unknown condition in Compile_Time_Warning.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on a pragma Compile_Time_Warning or
     Compile_Time_Error whose condition has a value that is not known at
     compile time.

‘-gnatwd’

     ‘Activate warnings on implicit dereferencing.’

     If this switch is set, then the use of a prefix of an access type
     in an indexed component, slice, or selected component without an
     explicit ‘.all’ will generate a warning.  With this warning
     enabled, access checks occur only at points where an explicit
     ‘.all’ appears in the source code (assuming no warnings are
     generated as a result of this switch).  The default is that such
     warnings are not generated.

‘-gnatwD’

     ‘Suppress warnings on implicit dereferencing.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for implicit dereferences in
     indexed components, slices, and selected components.

‘-gnatw.d’

     ‘Activate tagging of warning and info messages.’

     If this switch is set, then warning messages are tagged, with one
     of the following strings:

             - ‘[-gnatw?]’ Used to tag warnings controlled by the switch
               ‘-gnatwx’ where x is a letter a-z.

             - ‘[-gnatw.?]’ Used to tag warnings controlled by the
               switch ‘-gnatw.x’ where x is a letter a-z.

             - ‘[-gnatel]’ Used to tag elaboration information (info)
               messages generated when the static model of elaboration
               is used and the ‘-gnatel’ switch is set.

             - ‘[restriction warning]’ Used to tag warning messages for
               restriction violations, activated by use of the pragma
               ‘Restriction_Warnings’.

             - ‘[warning-as-error]’ Used to tag warning messages that
               have been converted to error messages by use of the
               pragma Warning_As_Error.  Note that such warnings are
               prefixed by the string “error: ” rather than “warning: “.

             - ‘[enabled by default]’ Used to tag all other warnings
               that are always given by default, unless warnings are
               completely suppressed using pragma ‘Warnings(Off)’ or the
               switch ‘-gnatws’.

‘-gnatw.D’

     ‘Deactivate tagging of warning and info messages messages.’

     If this switch is set, then warning messages return to the default
     mode in which warnings and info messages are not tagged as
     described above for ‘-gnatw.d’.

‘-gnatwe’

     ‘Treat warnings and style checks as errors.’

     This switch causes warning messages and style check messages to be
     treated as errors.  The warning string still appears, but the
     warning messages are counted as errors, and prevent the generation
     of an object file.  Note that this is the only -gnatw switch that
     affects the handling of style check messages.  Note also that this
     switch has no effect on info (information) messages, which are not
     treated as errors if this switch is present.

‘-gnatw.e’

     ‘Activate every optional warning.’

     This switch activates all optional warnings, including those which
     are not activated by ‘-gnatwa’.  The use of this switch is not
     recommended for normal use.  If you turn this switch on, it is
     almost certain that you will get large numbers of useless warnings.
     The warnings that are excluded from ‘-gnatwa’ are typically highly
     specialized warnings that are suitable for use only in code that
     has been specifically designed according to specialized coding
     rules.

‘-gnatwE’

     ‘Treat all run-time exception warnings as errors.’

     This switch causes warning messages regarding errors that will be
     raised during run-time execution to be treated as errors.

‘-gnatwf’

     ‘Activate warnings on unreferenced formals.’

     This switch causes a warning to be generated if a formal parameter
     is not referenced in the body of the subprogram.  This warning can
     also be turned on using ‘-gnatwu’.  The default is that these
     warnings are not generated.

‘-gnatwF’

     ‘Suppress warnings on unreferenced formals.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for unreferenced formal parameters.
     Note that the combination ‘-gnatwu’ followed by ‘-gnatwF’ has the
     effect of warning on unreferenced entities other than subprogram
     formals.

‘-gnatwg’

     ‘Activate warnings on unrecognized pragmas.’

     This switch causes a warning to be generated if an unrecognized
     pragma is encountered.  Apart from issuing this warning, the pragma
     is ignored and has no effect.  The default is that such warnings
     are issued (satisfying the Ada Reference Manual requirement that
     such warnings appear).

‘-gnatwG’

     ‘Suppress warnings on unrecognized pragmas.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for unrecognized pragmas.

‘-gnatw.g’

     ‘Warnings used for GNAT sources.’

     This switch sets the warning categories that are used by the
     standard GNAT style.  Currently this is equivalent to
     ‘-gnatwAao.q.s.CI.V.X.Z’ but more warnings may be added in the
     future without advanced notice.

‘-gnatwh’

     ‘Activate warnings on hiding.’

     This switch activates warnings on hiding declarations that are
     considered potentially confusing.  Not all cases of hiding cause
     warnings; for example an overriding declaration hides an implicit
     declaration, which is just normal code.  The default is that
     warnings on hiding are not generated.

‘-gnatwH’

     ‘Suppress warnings on hiding.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on hiding declarations.

‘-gnatw.h’

     ‘Activate warnings on holes/gaps in records.’

     This switch activates warnings on component clauses in record
     representation clauses that leave holes (gaps) in the record
     layout.  If a record representation clause does not specify a
     location for every component of the record type, then the warnings
     generated (or not generated) are unspecified.  For example, there
     may be gaps for which either no warning is generated or a warning
     is generated that incorrectly describes the location of the gap.
     This undesirable situation can sometimes be avoided by adding (and
     specifying the location for) unused fill fields.

‘-gnatw.H’

     ‘Suppress warnings on holes/gaps in records.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on component clauses in record
     representation clauses that leave holes (haps) in the record
     layout.

‘-gnatwi’

     ‘Activate warnings on implementation units.’

     This switch activates warnings for a ‘with’ of an internal GNAT
     implementation unit, defined as any unit from the ‘Ada’,
     ‘Interfaces’, ‘GNAT’, or ‘System’ hierarchies that is not
     documented in either the Ada Reference Manual or the GNAT
     Programmer’s Reference Manual.  Such units are intended only for
     internal implementation purposes and should not be ‘with’ed by user
     programs.  The default is that such warnings are generated

‘-gnatwI’

     ‘Disable warnings on implementation units.’

     This switch disables warnings for a ‘with’ of an internal GNAT
     implementation unit.

‘-gnatw.i’

     ‘Activate warnings on overlapping actuals.’

     This switch enables a warning on statically detectable overlapping
     actuals in a subprogram call, when one of the actuals is an in-out
     parameter, and the types of the actuals are not by-copy types.
     This warning is off by default.

‘-gnatw.I’

     ‘Disable warnings on overlapping actuals.’

     This switch disables warnings on overlapping actuals in a call.

‘-gnatwj’

     ‘Activate warnings on obsolescent features (Annex J).’

     If this warning option is activated, then warnings are generated
     for calls to subprograms marked with ‘pragma Obsolescent’ and for
     use of features in Annex J of the Ada Reference Manual.  In the
     case of Annex J, not all features are flagged.  In particular, uses
     of package ‘ASCII’ are not flagged, since these are very common and
     would generate many annoying positive warnings.  The default is
     that such warnings are not generated.

     In addition to the above cases, warnings are also generated for
     GNAT features that have been provided in past versions but which
     have been superseded (typically by features in the new Ada
     standard).  For example, ‘pragma Ravenscar’ will be flagged since
     its function is replaced by ‘pragma Profile(Ravenscar)’, and
     ‘pragma Interface_Name’ will be flagged since its function is
     replaced by ‘pragma Import’.

     Note that this warning option functions differently from the
     restriction ‘No_Obsolescent_Features’ in two respects.  First, the
     restriction applies only to annex J features.  Second, the
     restriction does flag uses of package ‘ASCII’.

‘-gnatwJ’

     ‘Suppress warnings on obsolescent features (Annex J).’

     This switch disables warnings on use of obsolescent features.

‘-gnatw.j’

     ‘Activate warnings on late declarations of tagged type primitives.’

     This switch activates warnings on visible primitives added to a
     tagged type after deriving a private extension from it.

‘-gnatw.J’

     ‘Suppress warnings on late declarations of tagged type primitives.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on visible primitives added to a
     tagged type after deriving a private extension from it.

‘-gnatwk’

     ‘Activate warnings on variables that could be constants.’

     This switch activates warnings for variables that are initialized
     but never modified, and then could be declared constants.  The
     default is that such warnings are not given.

‘-gnatwK’

     ‘Suppress warnings on variables that could be constants.’

     This switch disables warnings on variables that could be declared
     constants.

‘-gnatw.k’

     ‘Activate warnings on redefinition of names in standard.’

     This switch activates warnings for declarations that declare a name
     that is defined in package Standard.  Such declarations can be
     confusing, especially since the names in package Standard continue
     to be directly visible, meaning that use visibility on such
     redeclared names does not work as expected.  Names of discriminants
     and components in records are not included in this check.

‘-gnatw.K’

     ‘Suppress warnings on redefinition of names in standard.’

     This switch disables warnings for declarations that declare a name
     that is defined in package Standard.

‘-gnatwl’

     ‘Activate warnings for elaboration pragmas.’

     This switch activates warnings for possible elaboration problems,
     including suspicious use of ‘Elaborate’ pragmas, when using the
     static elaboration model, and possible situations that may raise
     ‘Program_Error’ when using the dynamic elaboration model.  See the
     section in this guide on elaboration checking for further details.
     The default is that such warnings are not generated.

‘-gnatwL’

     ‘Suppress warnings for elaboration pragmas.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for possible elaboration problems.

‘-gnatw.l’

     ‘List inherited aspects.’

     This switch causes the compiler to list inherited invariants,
     preconditions, and postconditions from Type_Invariant’Class,
     Invariant’Class, Pre’Class, and Post’Class aspects.  Also list
     inherited subtype predicates.

‘-gnatw.L’

     ‘Suppress listing of inherited aspects.’

     This switch suppresses listing of inherited aspects.

‘-gnatwm’

     ‘Activate warnings on modified but unreferenced variables.’

     This switch activates warnings for variables that are assigned
     (using an initialization value or with one or more assignment
     statements) but whose value is never read.  The warning is
     suppressed for volatile variables and also for variables that are
     renamings of other variables or for which an address clause is
     given.  The default is that these warnings are not given.

‘-gnatwM’

     ‘Disable warnings on modified but unreferenced variables.’

     This switch disables warnings for variables that are assigned or
     initialized, but never read.

‘-gnatw.m’

     ‘Activate warnings on suspicious modulus values.’

     This switch activates warnings for modulus values that seem
     suspicious.  The cases caught are where the size is the same as the
     modulus (e.g.  a modulus of 7 with a size of 7 bits), and modulus
     values of 32 or 64 with no size clause.  The guess in both cases is
     that 2**x was intended rather than x.  In addition expressions of
     the form 2*x for small x generate a warning (the almost certainly
     accurate guess being that 2**x was intended).  This switch also
     activates warnings for negative literal values of a modular type,
     which are interpreted as large positive integers after wrap-around.
     The default is that these warnings are given.

‘-gnatw.M’

     ‘Disable warnings on suspicious modulus values.’

     This switch disables warnings for suspicious modulus values.

‘-gnatwn’

     ‘Set normal warnings mode.’

     This switch sets normal warning mode, in which enabled warnings are
     issued and treated as warnings rather than errors.  This is the
     default mode.  the switch ‘-gnatwn’ can be used to cancel the
     effect of an explicit ‘-gnatws’ or ‘-gnatwe’.  It also cancels the
     effect of the implicit ‘-gnatwe’ that is activated by the use of
     ‘-gnatg’.

‘-gnatw.n’

     ‘Activate warnings on atomic synchronization.’

     This switch actives warnings when an access to an atomic variable
     requires the generation of atomic synchronization code.  These
     warnings are off by default.

‘-gnatw.N’

     ‘Suppress warnings on atomic synchronization.’

     This switch suppresses warnings when an access to an atomic
     variable requires the generation of atomic synchronization code.

‘-gnatwo’

     ‘Activate warnings on address clause overlays.’

     This switch activates warnings for possibly unintended
     initialization effects of defining address clauses that cause one
     variable to overlap another.  The default is that such warnings are
     generated.

‘-gnatwO’

     ‘Suppress warnings on address clause overlays.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on possibly unintended
     initialization effects of defining address clauses that cause one
     variable to overlap another.

‘-gnatw.o’

     ‘Activate warnings on modified but unreferenced out parameters.’

     This switch activates warnings for variables that are modified by
     using them as actuals for a call to a procedure with an out mode
     formal, where the resulting assigned value is never read.  It is
     applicable in the case where there is more than one out mode
     formal.  If there is only one out mode formal, the warning is
     issued by default (controlled by -gnatwu).  The warning is
     suppressed for volatile variables and also for variables that are
     renamings of other variables or for which an address clause is
     given.  The default is that these warnings are not given.

‘-gnatw.O’

     ‘Disable warnings on modified but unreferenced out parameters.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for variables that are modified by
     using them as actuals for a call to a procedure with an out mode
     formal, where the resulting assigned value is never read.

‘-gnatwp’

     ‘Activate warnings on ineffective pragma Inlines.’

     This switch activates warnings for failure of front end inlining
     (activated by ‘-gnatN’) to inline a particular call.  There are
     many reasons for not being able to inline a call, including most
     commonly that the call is too complex to inline.  The default is
     that such warnings are not given.  Warnings on ineffective inlining
     by the gcc back-end can be activated separately, using the gcc
     switch -Winline.

‘-gnatwP’

     ‘Suppress warnings on ineffective pragma Inlines.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on ineffective pragma Inlines.  If
     the inlining mechanism cannot inline a call, it will simply ignore
     the request silently.

‘-gnatw.p’

     ‘Activate warnings on parameter ordering.’

     This switch activates warnings for cases of suspicious parameter
     ordering when the list of arguments are all simple identifiers that
     match the names of the formals, but are in a different order.  The
     warning is suppressed if any use of named parameter notation is
     used, so this is the appropriate way to suppress a false positive
     (and serves to emphasize that the “misordering” is deliberate).
     The default is that such warnings are not given.

‘-gnatw.P’

     ‘Suppress warnings on parameter ordering.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on cases of suspicious parameter
     ordering.

‘-gnatw_p’

     ‘Activate warnings for pedantic checks.’

     This switch activates warnings for the failure of certain pedantic
     checks.  The only case currently supported is a check that the
     subtype_marks given for corresponding formal parameter and function
     results in a subprogram declaration and its body denote the same
     subtype declaration.  The default is that such warnings are not
     given.

‘-gnatw_P’

     ‘Suppress warnings for pedantic checks.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on violations of pedantic checks.

‘-gnatwq’

     ‘Activate warnings on questionable missing parentheses.’

     This switch activates warnings for cases where parentheses are not
     used and the result is potential ambiguity from a readers point of
     view.  For example (not a > b) when a and b are modular means ((not
     a) > b) and very likely the programmer intended (not (a > b)).
     Similarly (-x mod 5) means (-(x mod 5)) and quite likely ((-x) mod
     5) was intended.  In such situations it seems best to follow the
     rule of always parenthesizing to make the association clear, and
     this warning switch warns if such parentheses are not present.  The
     default is that these warnings are given.

‘-gnatwQ’

     ‘Suppress warnings on questionable missing parentheses.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for cases where the association is
     not clear and the use of parentheses is preferred.

‘-gnatw.q’

     ‘Activate warnings on questionable layout of record types.’

     This switch activates warnings for cases where the default layout
     of a record type, that is to say the layout of its components in
     textual order of the source code, would very likely cause
     inefficiencies in the code generated by the compiler, both in terms
     of space and speed during execution.  One warning is issued for
     each problematic component without representation clause in the
     nonvariant part and then in each variant recursively, if any.

     The purpose of these warnings is neither to prescribe an optimal
     layout nor to force the use of representation clauses, but rather
     to get rid of the most blatant inefficiencies in the layout.
     Therefore, the default layout is matched against the following
     synthetic ordered layout and the deviations are flagged on a
     component-by-component basis:

        * first all components or groups of components whose length is
          fixed and a multiple of the storage unit,

        * then the remaining components whose length is fixed and not a
          multiple of the storage unit,

        * then the remaining components whose length doesn’t depend on
          discriminants (that is to say, with variable but uniform
          length for all objects),

        * then all components whose length depends on discriminants,

        * finally the variant part (if any),

     for the nonvariant part and for each variant recursively, if any.

     The exact wording of the warning depends on whether the compiler is
     allowed to reorder the components in the record type or precluded
     from doing it by means of pragma ‘No_Component_Reordering’.

     The default is that these warnings are not given.

‘-gnatw.Q’

     ‘Suppress warnings on questionable layout of record types.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for cases where the default layout
     of a record type would very likely cause inefficiencies.

‘-gnatw_q’

     ‘Activate warnings for ignored equality operators.’

     This switch activates warnings for a user-defined “=” function that
     does not compose (i.e.  is ignored for a predefined “=” for a
     composite type containing a component whose type has the
     user-defined “=” as primitive).  Note that the user-defined “=”
     must be a primitive operator in order to trigger the warning.  See
     RM-4.5.2(14/3-15/5, 21, 24/3, 32.1/1) for the exact Ada rules on
     composability of “=”.

     The default is that these warnings are not given.

‘-gnatw_Q’

     ‘Suppress warnings for ignored equality operators.’

‘-gnatwr’

     ‘Activate warnings on redundant constructs.’

     This switch activates warnings for redundant constructs.  The
     following is the current list of constructs regarded as redundant:

        * Assignment of an item to itself.

        * Type conversion that converts an expression to its own type.

        * Use of the attribute ‘Base’ where ‘typ'Base’ is the same as
          ‘typ’.

        * Use of pragma ‘Pack’ when all components are placed by a
          record representation clause.

        * Exception handler containing only a reraise statement (raise
          with no operand) which has no effect.

        * Use of the operator abs on an operand that is known at compile
          time to be non-negative

        * Comparison of an object or (unary or binary) operation of
          boolean type to an explicit True value.

        * Import of parent package.

     The default is that warnings for redundant constructs are not
     given.

‘-gnatwR’

     ‘Suppress warnings on redundant constructs.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for redundant constructs.

‘-gnatw.r’

     ‘Activate warnings for object renaming function.’

     This switch activates warnings for an object renaming that renames
     a function call, which is equivalent to a constant declaration (as
     opposed to renaming the function itself).  The default is that
     these warnings are given.

‘-gnatw.R’

     ‘Suppress warnings for object renaming function.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for object renaming function.

‘-gnatw_r’

     ‘Activate warnings for out-of-order record representation clauses.’

     This switch activates warnings for record representation clauses,
     if the order of component declarations, component clauses, and
     bit-level layout do not all agree.  The default is that these
     warnings are not given.

‘-gnatw_R’

     ‘Suppress warnings for out-of-order record representation clauses.’

‘-gnatws’

     ‘Suppress all warnings.’

     This switch completely suppresses the output of all warning
     messages from the GNAT front end, including both warnings that can
     be controlled by switches described in this section, and those that
     are normally given unconditionally.  The effect of this suppress
     action can only be cancelled by a subsequent use of the switch
     ‘-gnatwn’.

     Note that switch ‘-gnatws’ does not suppress warnings from the
     ‘gcc’ back end.  To suppress these back end warnings as well, use
     the switch ‘-w’ in addition to ‘-gnatws’.  Also this switch has no
     effect on the handling of style check messages.

‘-gnatw.s’

     ‘Activate warnings on overridden size clauses.’

     This switch activates warnings on component clauses in record
     representation clauses where the length given overrides that
     specified by an explicit size clause for the component type.  A
     warning is similarly given in the array case if a specified
     component size overrides an explicit size clause for the array
     component type.

‘-gnatw.S’

     ‘Suppress warnings on overridden size clauses.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on component clauses in record
     representation clauses that override size clauses, and similar
     warnings when an array component size overrides a size clause.

‘-gnatw_s’

     ‘Activate warnings on ineffective predicate tests.’

     This switch activates warnings on Static_Predicate aspect
     specifications that test for values that do not belong to the
     parent subtype.  Not all such ineffective tests are detected.

‘-gnatw_S’

     ‘Suppress warnings on ineffective predicate tests.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on Static_Predicate aspect
     specifications that test for values that do not belong to the
     parent subtype.

‘-gnatwt’

     ‘Activate warnings for tracking of deleted conditional code.’

     This switch activates warnings for tracking of code in conditionals
     (IF and CASE statements) that is detected to be dead code which
     cannot be executed, and which is removed by the front end.  This
     warning is off by default.  This may be useful for detecting
     deactivated code in certified applications.

‘-gnatwT’

     ‘Suppress warnings for tracking of deleted conditional code.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for tracking of deleted conditional
     code.

‘-gnatw.t’

     ‘Activate warnings on suspicious contracts.’

     This switch activates warnings on suspicious contracts.  This
     includes warnings on suspicious postconditions (whether a pragma
     ‘Postcondition’ or a ‘Post’ aspect in Ada 2012) and suspicious
     contract cases (pragma or aspect ‘Contract_Cases’).  A function
     postcondition or contract case is suspicious when no postcondition
     or contract case for this function mentions the result of the
     function.  A procedure postcondition or contract case is suspicious
     when it only refers to the pre-state of the procedure, because in
     that case it should rather be expressed as a precondition.  This
     switch also controls warnings on suspicious cases of expressions
     typically found in contracts like quantified expressions and uses
     of Update attribute.  The default is that such warnings are
     generated.

‘-gnatw.T’

     ‘Suppress warnings on suspicious contracts.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on suspicious contracts.

‘-gnatwu’

     ‘Activate warnings on unused entities.’

     This switch activates warnings to be generated for entities that
     are declared but not referenced, and for units that are ‘with’ed
     and not referenced.  In the case of packages, a warning is also
     generated if no entities in the package are referenced.  This means
     that if a with’ed package is referenced but the only references are
     in ‘use’ clauses or ‘renames’ declarations, a warning is still
     generated.  A warning is also generated for a generic package that
     is ‘with’ed but never instantiated.  In the case where a package or
     subprogram body is compiled, and there is a ‘with’ on the
     corresponding spec that is only referenced in the body, a warning
     is also generated, noting that the ‘with’ can be moved to the body.
     The default is that such warnings are not generated.  This switch
     also activates warnings on unreferenced formals (it includes the
     effect of ‘-gnatwf’).

‘-gnatwU’

     ‘Suppress warnings on unused entities.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for unused entities and packages.
     It also turns off warnings on unreferenced formals (and thus
     includes the effect of ‘-gnatwF’).

‘-gnatw.u’

     ‘Activate warnings on unordered enumeration types.’

     This switch causes enumeration types to be considered as
     conceptually unordered, unless an explicit pragma ‘Ordered’ is
     given for the type.  The effect is to generate warnings in clients
     that use explicit comparisons or subranges, since these constructs
     both treat objects of the type as ordered.  (A ‘client’ is defined
     as a unit that is other than the unit in which the type is
     declared, or its body or subunits.)  Please refer to the
     description of pragma ‘Ordered’ in the ‘GNAT Reference Manual’ for
     further details.  The default is that such warnings are not
     generated.

‘-gnatw.U’

     ‘Deactivate warnings on unordered enumeration types.’

     This switch causes all enumeration types to be considered as
     ordered, so that no warnings are given for comparisons or subranges
     for any type.

‘-gnatwv’

     ‘Activate warnings on unassigned variables.’

     This switch activates warnings for access to variables which may
     not be properly initialized.  The default is that such warnings are
     generated.  This switch will also be emitted when initializing an
     array or record object via the following aggregate:

          Array_Or_Record : XXX := (others => <>);

     unless the relevant type fully initializes all components.

‘-gnatwV’

     ‘Suppress warnings on unassigned variables.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for access to variables which may
     not be properly initialized.

‘-gnatw.v’

     ‘Activate info messages for non-default bit order.’

     This switch activates messages (labeled “info”, they are not
     warnings, just informational messages) about the effects of
     non-default bit-order on records to which a component clause is
     applied.  The effect of specifying non-default bit ordering is a
     bit subtle (and changed with Ada 2005), so these messages, which
     are given by default, are useful in understanding the exact
     consequences of using this feature.

‘-gnatw.V’

     ‘Suppress info messages for non-default bit order.’

     This switch suppresses information messages for the effects of
     specifying non-default bit order on record components with
     component clauses.

‘-gnatww’

     ‘Activate warnings on wrong low bound assumption.’

     This switch activates warnings for indexing an unconstrained string
     parameter with a literal or S’Length.  This is a case where the
     code is assuming that the low bound is one, which is in general not
     true (for example when a slice is passed).  The default is that
     such warnings are generated.

‘-gnatwW’

     ‘Suppress warnings on wrong low bound assumption.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for indexing an unconstrained
     string parameter with a literal or S’Length.  Note that this
     warning can also be suppressed in a particular case by adding an
     assertion that the lower bound is 1, as shown in the following
     example:

          procedure K (S : String) is
             pragma Assert (S'First = 1);
             ...

‘-gnatw.w’

     ‘Activate warnings on Warnings Off pragmas.’

     This switch activates warnings for use of ‘pragma Warnings (Off,
     entity)’ where either the pragma is entirely useless (because it
     suppresses no warnings), or it could be replaced by ‘pragma
     Unreferenced’ or ‘pragma Unmodified’.  Also activates warnings for
     the case of Warnings (Off, String), where either there is no
     matching Warnings (On, String), or the Warnings (Off) did not
     suppress any warning.  The default is that these warnings are not
     given.

‘-gnatw.W’

     ‘Suppress warnings on unnecessary Warnings Off pragmas.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for use of ‘pragma Warnings (Off,
     ...)’.

‘-gnatwx’

     ‘Activate warnings on Export/Import pragmas.’

     This switch activates warnings on Export/Import pragmas when the
     compiler detects a possible conflict between the Ada and foreign
     language calling sequences.  For example, the use of default
     parameters in a convention C procedure is dubious because the C
     compiler cannot supply the proper default, so a warning is issued.
     The default is that such warnings are generated.

‘-gnatwX’

     ‘Suppress warnings on Export/Import pragmas.’

     This switch suppresses warnings on Export/Import pragmas.  The
     sense of this is that you are telling the compiler that you know
     what you are doing in writing the pragma, and it should not
     complain at you.

‘-gnatw.x’

     ‘Activate warnings for No_Exception_Propagation mode.’

     This switch activates warnings for exception usage when pragma
     Restrictions (No_Exception_Propagation) is in effect.  Warnings are
     given for implicit or explicit exception raises which are not
     covered by a local handler, and for exception handlers which do not
     cover a local raise.  The default is that these warnings are given
     for units that contain exception handlers.

‘-gnatw.X’

     ‘Disable warnings for No_Exception_Propagation mode.’

     This switch disables warnings for exception usage when pragma
     Restrictions (No_Exception_Propagation) is in effect.

‘-gnatwy’

     ‘Activate warnings for Ada compatibility issues.’

     For the most part, newer versions of Ada are upwards compatible
     with older versions.  For example, Ada 2005 programs will almost
     always work when compiled as Ada 2012.  However there are some
     exceptions (for example the fact that ‘some’ is now a reserved word
     in Ada 2012).  This switch activates several warnings to help in
     identifying and correcting such incompatibilities.  The default is
     that these warnings are generated.  Note that at one point Ada 2005
     was called Ada 0Y, hence the choice of character.

‘-gnatwY’

     ‘Disable warnings for Ada compatibility issues.’

     This switch suppresses the warnings intended to help in identifying
     incompatibilities between Ada language versions.

‘-gnatw.y’

     ‘Activate information messages for why package spec needs body.’

     There are a number of cases in which a package spec needs a body.
     For example, the use of pragma Elaborate_Body, or the declaration
     of a procedure specification requiring a completion.  This switch
     causes information messages to be output showing why a package
     specification requires a body.  This can be useful in the case of a
     large package specification which is unexpectedly requiring a body.
     The default is that such information messages are not output.

‘-gnatw.Y’

     ‘Disable information messages for why package spec needs body.’

     This switch suppresses the output of information messages showing
     why a package specification needs a body.

‘-gnatwz’

     ‘Activate warnings on unchecked conversions.’

     This switch activates warnings for unchecked conversions where the
     types are known at compile time to have different sizes.  The
     default is that such warnings are generated.  Warnings are also
     generated for subprogram pointers with different conventions.

‘-gnatwZ’

     ‘Suppress warnings on unchecked conversions.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for unchecked conversions where the
     types are known at compile time to have different sizes or
     conventions.

‘-gnatw.z’

     ‘Activate warnings for size not a multiple of alignment.’

     This switch activates warnings for cases of array and record types
     with specified ‘Size’ and ‘Alignment’ attributes where the size is
     not a multiple of the alignment, resulting in an object size that
     is greater than the specified size.  The default is that such
     warnings are generated.

‘-gnatw.Z’

     ‘Suppress warnings for size not a multiple of alignment.’

     This switch suppresses warnings for cases of array and record types
     with specified ‘Size’ and ‘Alignment’ attributes where the size is
     not a multiple of the alignment, resulting in an object size that
     is greater than the specified size.  The warning can also be
     suppressed by giving an explicit ‘Object_Size’ value.

‘-Wunused’

     The warnings controlled by the ‘-gnatw’ switch are generated by the
     front end of the compiler.  The GCC back end can provide additional
     warnings and they are controlled by the ‘-W’ switch.  For example,
     ‘-Wunused’ activates back end warnings for entities that are
     declared but not referenced.

‘-Wuninitialized’

     Similarly, ‘-Wuninitialized’ activates the back end warning for
     uninitialized variables.  This switch must be used in conjunction
     with an optimization level greater than zero.

‘-Wstack-usage=`len'’

     Warn if the stack usage of a subprogram might be larger than ‘len’
     bytes.  See *note Static Stack Usage Analysis: e8. for details.

‘-Wall’

     This switch enables most warnings from the GCC back end.  The code
     generator detects a number of warning situations that are missed by
     the GNAT front end, and this switch can be used to activate them.
     The use of this switch also sets the default front-end warning mode
     to ‘-gnatwa’, that is, most front-end warnings are activated as
     well.

‘-w’

     Conversely, this switch suppresses warnings from the GCC back end.
     The use of this switch also sets the default front-end warning mode
     to ‘-gnatws’, that is, front-end warnings are suppressed as well.

‘-Werror’

     This switch causes warnings from the GCC back end to be treated as
     errors.  The warning string still appears, but the warning messages
     are counted as errors, and prevent the generation of an object
     file.  The use of this switch also sets the default front-end
     warning mode to ‘-gnatwe’, that is, front-end warning messages and
     style check messages are treated as errors as well.

A string of warning parameters can be used in the same parameter.  For
example:

     -gnatwaGe

will turn on all optional warnings except for unrecognized pragma
warnings, and also specify that warnings should be treated as errors.

When no switch ‘-gnatw’ is used, this is equivalent to:

        * ‘-gnatw.a’

        * ‘-gnatwB’

        * ‘-gnatw.b’

        * ‘-gnatwC’

        * ‘-gnatw.C’

        * ‘-gnatwD’

        * ‘-gnatw.D’

        * ‘-gnatwF’

        * ‘-gnatw.F’

        * ‘-gnatwg’

        * ‘-gnatwH’

        * ‘-gnatw.H’

        * ‘-gnatwi’

        * ‘-gnatwJ’

        * ‘-gnatw.J’

        * ‘-gnatwK’

        * ‘-gnatw.K’

        * ‘-gnatwL’

        * ‘-gnatw.L’

        * ‘-gnatwM’

        * ‘-gnatw.m’

        * ‘-gnatwn’

        * ‘-gnatw.N’

        * ‘-gnatwo’

        * ‘-gnatw.O’

        * ‘-gnatwP’

        * ‘-gnatw.P’

        * ‘-gnatwq’

        * ‘-gnatw.Q’

        * ‘-gnatwR’

        * ‘-gnatw.R’

        * ‘-gnatw.S’

        * ‘-gnatwT’

        * ‘-gnatw.t’

        * ‘-gnatwU’

        * ‘-gnatw.U’

        * ‘-gnatwv’

        * ‘-gnatw.v’

        * ‘-gnatww’

        * ‘-gnatw.W’

        * ‘-gnatwx’

        * ‘-gnatw.X’

        * ‘-gnatwy’

4.3.4 Debugging and Assertion Control
-------------------------------------

‘-gnata’

     The ‘-gnata’ option is equivalent to the following
     ‘Assertion_Policy’ pragma:

          pragma Assertion_Policy (Check);

     Which is a shorthand for:

          pragma Assertion_Policy
          --  Ada RM assertion pragmas
            (Assert                    => Check,
             Static_Predicate          => Check,
             Dynamic_Predicate         => Check,
             Pre                       => Check,
             Pre'Class                 => Check,
             Post                      => Check,
             Post'Class                => Check,
             Type_Invariant            => Check,
             Type_Invariant'Class      => Check,
             Default_Initial_Condition => Check,
          --  GNAT specific assertion pragmas
             Assert_And_Cut            => Check,
             Assume                    => Check,
             Contract_Cases            => Check,
             Debug                     => Check,
             Ghost                     => Check,
             Initial_Condition         => Check,
             Loop_Invariant            => Check,
             Loop_Variant              => Check,
             Postcondition             => Check,
             Precondition              => Check,
             Predicate                 => Check,
             Refined_Post              => Check,
             Subprogram_Variant        => Check);

     The pragmas ‘Assert’ and ‘Debug’ normally have no effect and are
     ignored.  This switch, where ‘a’ stands for ‘assert’, causes
     pragmas ‘Assert’ and ‘Debug’ to be activated.  This switch also
     causes preconditions, postconditions, subtype predicates, and type
     invariants to be activated.

     The pragmas have the form:

          pragma Assert (<Boolean-expression> [, <static-string-expression>])
          pragma Debug (<procedure call>)
          pragma Type_Invariant (<type-local-name>, <Boolean-expression>)
          pragma Predicate (<type-local-name>, <Boolean-expression>)
          pragma Precondition (<Boolean-expression>, <string-expression>)
          pragma Postcondition (<Boolean-expression>, <string-expression>)

     The aspects have the form:

          with [Pre|Post|Type_Invariant|Dynamic_Predicate|Static_Predicate]
            => <Boolean-expression>;

     The ‘Assert’ pragma causes ‘Boolean-expression’ to be tested.  If
     the result is ‘True’, the pragma has no effect (other than possible
     side effects from evaluating the expression).  If the result is
     ‘False’, the exception ‘Assert_Failure’ declared in the package
     ‘System.Assertions’ is raised (passing ‘static-string-expression’,
     if present, as the message associated with the exception).  If no
     string expression is given, the default is a string containing the
     file name and line number of the pragma.

     The ‘Debug’ pragma causes ‘procedure’ to be called.  Note that
     ‘pragma Debug’ may appear within a declaration sequence, allowing
     debugging procedures to be called between declarations.

     For the aspect specification, the ‘Boolean-expression’ is
     evaluated.  If the result is ‘True’, the aspect has no effect.  If
     the result is ‘False’, the exception ‘Assert_Failure’ is raised.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Validity Checking,  Next: Style Checking,  Prev: Debugging and Assertion Control,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.5 Validity Checking
-----------------------

The Ada Reference Manual defines the concept of invalid values (see RM
13.9.1).  The primary source of invalid values is uninitialized
variables.  A scalar variable that is left uninitialized may contain an
invalid value; the concept of invalid does not apply to access or
composite types.

It is an error to read an invalid value, but the RM does not require
run-time checks to detect such errors, except for some minimal checking
to prevent erroneous execution (i.e.  unpredictable behavior).  This
corresponds to the ‘-gnatVd’ switch below, which is the default.  For
example, by default, if the expression of a case statement is invalid,
it will raise Constraint_Error rather than causing a wild jump, and if
an array index on the left-hand side of an assignment is invalid, it
will raise Constraint_Error rather than overwriting an arbitrary memory
location.

The ‘-gnatVa’ may be used to enable additional validity checks, which
are not required by the RM. These checks are often very expensive (which
is why the RM does not require them).  These checks are useful in
tracking down uninitialized variables, but they are not usually
recommended for production builds, and in particular we do not recommend
using these extra validity checking options in combination with
optimization, since this can confuse the optimizer.  If performance is a
consideration, leading to the need to optimize, then the validity
checking options should not be used.

The other ‘-gnatV`x'’ switches below allow finer-grained control; you
can enable whichever validity checks you desire.  However, for most
debugging purposes, ‘-gnatVa’ is sufficient, and the default ‘-gnatVd’
(i.e.  standard Ada behavior) is usually sufficient for non-debugging
use.

The ‘-gnatB’ switch tells the compiler to assume that all values are
valid (that is, within their declared subtype range) except in the
context of a use of the Valid attribute.  This means the compiler can
generate more efficient code, since the range of values is better known
at compile time.  However, an uninitialized variable can cause wild
jumps and memory corruption in this mode.

The ‘-gnatV`x'’ switch allows control over the validity checking mode as
described below.  The ‘x’ argument is a string of letters that indicate
validity checks that are performed or not performed in addition to the
default checks required by Ada as described above.

‘-gnatVa’

     ‘All validity checks.’

     All validity checks are turned on.  That is, ‘-gnatVa’ is
     equivalent to ‘gnatVcdefimoprst’.

‘-gnatVc’

     ‘Validity checks for copies.’

     The right-hand side of assignments, and the (explicit) initializing
     values of object declarations are validity checked.

‘-gnatVd’

     ‘Default (RM) validity checks.’

     Some validity checks are required by Ada (see RM 13.9.1 (9-11));
     these (and only these) validity checks are enabled by default.  For
     case statements (and case expressions) that lack a “when others =>”
     choice, a check is made that the value of the selector expression
     belongs to its nominal subtype.  If it does not, Constraint_Error
     is raised.  For assignments to array components (and for indexed
     components in some other contexts), a check is made that each index
     expression belongs to the corresponding index subtype.  If it does
     not, Constraint_Error is raised.  Both these validity checks may be
     turned off using switch ‘-gnatVD’.  They are turned on by default.
     If ‘-gnatVD’ is specified, a subsequent switch ‘-gnatVd’ will leave
     the checks turned on.  Switch ‘-gnatVD’ should be used only if you
     are sure that all such expressions have valid values.  If you use
     this switch and invalid values are present, then the program is
     erroneous, and wild jumps or memory overwriting may occur.

‘-gnatVe’

     ‘Validity checks for scalar components.’

     In the absence of this switch, assignments to scalar components of
     enclosing record or array objects are not validity checked, even if
     validity checks for assignments generally (‘-gnatVc’) are turned
     on.  Specifying this switch enables such checks.  This switch has
     no effect if the ‘-gnatVc’ switch is not specified.

‘-gnatVf’

     ‘Validity checks for floating-point values.’

     Specifying this switch enables validity checking for floating-point
     values in the same contexts where validity checking is enabled for
     other scalar values.  In the absence of this switch, validity
     checking is not performed for floating-point values.  This takes
     precedence over other statements about performing validity checking
     for scalar objects in various scenarios.  One way to look at it is
     that if this switch is not set, then whenever any of the other
     rules in this section use the word “scalar” they really mean
     “scalar and not floating-point”.  If ‘-gnatVf’ is specified, then
     validity checking also applies for floating-point values, and NaNs
     and infinities are considered invalid, as well as out-of-range
     values for constrained types.  The exact contexts in which
     floating-point values are checked depends on the setting of other
     options.  For example, ‘-gnatVif’ or ‘-gnatVfi’ (the order does not
     matter) specifies that floating-point parameters of mode ‘in’
     should be validity checked.

‘-gnatVi’

     ‘Validity checks for ‘‘in‘‘ mode parameters.’

     Arguments for parameters of mode ‘in’ are validity checked in
     function and procedure calls at the point of call.

‘-gnatVm’

     ‘Validity checks for ‘‘in out‘‘ mode parameters.’

     Arguments for parameters of mode ‘in out’ are validity checked in
     procedure calls at the point of call.  The ‘'m'’ here stands for
     modify, since this concerns parameters that can be modified by the
     call.  Note that there is no specific option to test ‘out’
     parameters, but any reference within the subprogram will be tested
     in the usual manner, and if an invalid value is copied back, any
     reference to it will be subject to validity checking.

‘-gnatVn’

     ‘No validity checks.’

     This switch turns off all validity checking, including the default
     checking for case statements and left hand side subscripts.  Note
     that the use of the switch ‘-gnatp’ suppresses all run-time checks,
     including validity checks, and thus implies ‘-gnatVn’.  When this
     switch is used, it cancels any other ‘-gnatV’ previously issued.

‘-gnatVo’

     ‘Validity checks for operator and attribute operands.’

     Scalar arguments for predefined operators and for attributes are
     validity checked.  This includes all operators in package
     ‘Standard’, the shift operators defined as intrinsic in package
     ‘Interfaces’ and operands for attributes such as ‘Pos’.  Checks are
     also made on individual component values for composite comparisons,
     and on the expressions in type conversions and qualified
     expressions.  Checks are also made on explicit ranges using ‘..’
     (e.g., slices, loops etc).

‘-gnatVp’

     ‘Validity checks for parameters.’

     This controls the treatment of formal parameters within a
     subprogram (as opposed to ‘-gnatVi’ and ‘-gnatVm’, which control
     validity testing of actual parameters of a call).  If either of
     these call options is specified, then normally an assumption is
     made within a subprogram that the validity of any incoming formal
     parameters of the corresponding mode(s) has already been checked at
     the point of call and does not need rechecking.  If ‘-gnatVp’ is
     set, then this assumption is not made and so their validity may be
     checked (or rechecked) within the subprogram.  If neither of the
     two call-related options is specified, then this switch has no
     effect.

‘-gnatVr’

     ‘Validity checks for function returns.’

     The expression in simple ‘return’ statements in functions is
     validity checked.

‘-gnatVs’

     ‘Validity checks for subscripts.’

     All subscript expressions are checked for validity, whatever
     context they occur in (in default mode some subscripts are not
     validity checked; for example, validity checking may be omitted in
     some cases involving a read of a component of an array).

‘-gnatVt’

     ‘Validity checks for tests.’

     Expressions used as conditions in ‘if’, ‘while’ or ‘exit’
     statements are checked, as well as guard expressions in entry
     calls.

The ‘-gnatV’ switch may be followed by a string of letters to turn on a
series of validity checking options.  For example, ‘-gnatVcr’ specifies
that in addition to the default validity checking, copies and function
return expressions are to be validity checked.  In order to make it
easier to specify the desired combination of effects, the upper case
letters ‘CDFIMORST’ may be used to turn off the corresponding lower case
option.  Thus ‘-gnatVaM’ turns on all validity checking options except
for checking of ‘in out’ parameters.

The specification of additional validity checking generates extra code
(and in the case of ‘-gnatVa’ the code expansion can be substantial).
However, these additional checks can be very useful in detecting
uninitialized variables, incorrect use of unchecked conversion, and
other errors leading to invalid values.  The use of pragma
‘Initialize_Scalars’ is useful in conjunction with the extra validity
checking, since this ensures that wherever possible uninitialized
variables have invalid values.

See also the pragma ‘Validity_Checks’ which allows modification of the
validity checking mode at the program source level, and also allows for
temporary disabling of validity checks.

4.3.6 Style Checking
--------------------

The ‘-gnaty’ switch causes the compiler to enforce specified style
rules.  A limited set of style rules has been used in writing the GNAT
sources themselves.  This switch allows user programs to activate all or
some of these checks.  If the source program fails a specified style
check, an appropriate message is given, preceded by the character
sequence ‘(style)’.  This message does not prevent successful
compilation (unless the ‘-gnatwe’ switch is used).

Note that this is by no means intended to be a general facility for
checking arbitrary coding standards.  It is simply an embedding of the
style rules we have chosen for the GNAT sources.  If you are starting a
project which does not have established style standards, you may find it
useful to adopt the entire set of GNAT coding standards, or some subset
of them.

The string ‘x’ is a sequence of letters or digits indicating the
particular style checks to be performed.  The following checks are
defined:

‘-gnaty0’

     ‘Specify indentation level.’

     If a digit from 1-9 appears in the string after ‘-gnaty’ then
     proper indentation is checked, with the digit indicating the
     indentation level required.  A value of zero turns off this style
     check.  The rule checks that the following constructs start on a
     column that is a multiple of the alignment level:

        * beginnings of declarations (except record component
          declarations) and statements;

        * beginnings of the structural components of compound
          statements;

        * ‘end’ keyword that completes the declaration of a program unit
          declaration or body or that completes a compound statement.

     Full line comments must be aligned with the ‘--’ starting on a
     column that is a multiple of the alignment level, or they may be
     aligned the same way as the following non-blank line (this is
     useful when full line comments appear in the middle of a statement,
     or they may be aligned with the source line on the previous
     non-blank line.

‘-gnatya’

     ‘Check attribute casing.’

     Attribute names, including the case of keywords such as ‘digits’
     used as attributes names, must be written in mixed case, that is,
     the initial letter and any letter following an underscore must be
     uppercase.  All other letters must be lowercase.

‘-gnatyA’

     ‘Use of array index numbers in array attributes.’

     When using the array attributes First, Last, Range, or Length, the
     index number must be omitted for one-dimensional arrays and is
     required for multi-dimensional arrays.

‘-gnatyb’

     ‘Blanks not allowed at statement end.’

     Trailing blanks are not allowed at the end of statements.  The
     purpose of this rule, together with h (no horizontal tabs), is to
     enforce a canonical format for the use of blanks to separate source
     tokens.

‘-gnatyB’

     ‘Check Boolean operators.’

     The use of AND/OR operators is not permitted except in the cases of
     modular operands, array operands, and simple stand-alone boolean
     variables or boolean constants.  In all other cases ‘and then’/‘or
     else’ are required.

‘-gnatyc’

     ‘Check comments, double space.’

     Comments must meet the following set of rules:

        * The ‘--’ that starts the column must either start in column
          one, or else at least one blank must precede this sequence.

        * Comments that follow other tokens on a line must have at least
          one blank following the ‘--’ at the start of the comment.

        * Full line comments must have at least two blanks following the
          ‘--’ that starts the comment, with the following exceptions.

        * A line consisting only of the ‘--’ characters, possibly
          preceded by blanks is permitted.

        * A comment starting with ‘--x’ where ‘x’ is a special character
          is permitted.  This allows proper processing of the output
          from specialized tools such as ‘gnatprep’ (where ‘--!’ is
          used) and in earlier versions of the SPARK annotation language
          (where ‘--#’ is used).  For the purposes of this rule, a
          special character is defined as being in one of the ASCII
          ranges ‘16#21#...16#2F#’ or ‘16#3A#...16#3F#’.  Note that this
          usage is not permitted in GNAT implementation units (i.e.,
          when ‘-gnatg’ is used).

        * A line consisting entirely of minus signs, possibly preceded
          by blanks, is permitted.  This allows the construction of box
          comments where lines of minus signs are used to form the top
          and bottom of the box.

        * A comment that starts and ends with ‘--’ is permitted as long
          as at least one blank follows the initial ‘--’.  Together with
          the preceding rule, this allows the construction of box
          comments, as shown in the following example:

               ---------------------------
               -- This is a box comment --
               -- with two text lines.  --
               ---------------------------

‘-gnatyC’

     ‘Check comments, single space.’

     This is identical to ‘c’ except that only one space is required
     following the ‘--’ of a comment instead of two.

‘-gnatyd’

     ‘Check no DOS line terminators present.’

     All lines must be terminated by a single ASCII.LF character (in
     particular the DOS line terminator sequence CR/LF is not allowed).

‘-gnatyD’

     ‘Check declared identifiers in mixed case.’

     Declared identifiers must be in mixed case, as in
     This_Is_An_Identifier.  Use -gnatyr in addition to ensure that
     references match declarations.

‘-gnatye’

     ‘Check end/exit labels.’

     Optional labels on ‘end’ statements ending subprograms and on
     ‘exit’ statements exiting named loops, are required to be present.

‘-gnatyf’

     ‘No form feeds or vertical tabs.’

     Neither form feeds nor vertical tab characters are permitted in the
     source text.

‘-gnatyg’

     ‘GNAT style mode.’

     The set of style check switches is set to match that used by the
     GNAT sources.  This may be useful when developing code that is
     eventually intended to be incorporated into GNAT. Currently this is
     equivalent to ‘-gnatyydISuxz’) but additional style switches may be
     added to this set in the future without advance notice.

‘-gnatyh’

     ‘No horizontal tabs.’

     Horizontal tab characters are not permitted in the source text.
     Together with the b (no blanks at end of line) check, this enforces
     a canonical form for the use of blanks to separate source tokens.

‘-gnatyi’

     ‘Check if-then layout.’

     The keyword ‘then’ must appear either on the same line as
     corresponding ‘if’, or on a line on its own, lined up under the
     ‘if’.

‘-gnatyI’

     ‘check mode IN keywords.’

     Mode ‘in’ (the default mode) is not allowed to be given explicitly.
     ‘in out’ is fine, but not ‘in’ on its own.

‘-gnatyk’

     ‘Check keyword casing.’

     All keywords must be in lower case (with the exception of keywords
     such as ‘digits’ used as attribute names to which this check does
     not apply).  A single error is reported for each line breaking this
     rule even if multiple casing issues exist on a same line.

‘-gnatyl’

     ‘Check layout.’

     Layout of statement and declaration constructs must follow the
     recommendations in the Ada Reference Manual, as indicated by the
     form of the syntax rules.  For example an ‘else’ keyword must be
     lined up with the corresponding ‘if’ keyword.

     There are two respects in which the style rule enforced by this
     check option are more liberal than those in the Ada Reference
     Manual.  First in the case of record declarations, it is
     permissible to put the ‘record’ keyword on the same line as the
     ‘type’ keyword, and then the ‘end’ in ‘end record’ must line up
     under ‘type’.  This is also permitted when the type declaration is
     split on two lines.  For example, any of the following three
     layouts is acceptable:

          type q is record
             a : integer;
             b : integer;
          end record;

          type q is
             record
                a : integer;
                b : integer;
             end record;

          type q is
             record
                a : integer;
                b : integer;
          end record;

     Second, in the case of a block statement, a permitted alternative
     is to put the block label on the same line as the ‘declare’ or
     ‘begin’ keyword, and then line the ‘end’ keyword up under the block
     label.  For example both the following are permitted:

          Block : declare
             A : Integer := 3;
          begin
             Proc (A, A);
          end Block;

          Block :
             declare
                A : Integer := 3;
             begin
                Proc (A, A);
             end Block;

     The same alternative format is allowed for loops.  For example,
     both of the following are permitted:

          Clear : while J < 10 loop
             A (J) := 0;
          end loop Clear;

          Clear :
             while J < 10 loop
                A (J) := 0;
             end loop Clear;

‘-gnatyL’

     ‘Set maximum nesting level.’

     The maximum level of nesting of constructs (including subprograms,
     loops, blocks, packages, and conditionals) may not exceed the given
     value ‘nnn’.  A value of zero disconnects this style check.

‘-gnatym’

     ‘Check maximum line length.’

     The length of source lines must not exceed 79 characters, including
     any trailing blanks.  The value of 79 allows convenient display on
     an 80 character wide device or window, allowing for possible
     special treatment of 80 character lines.  Note that this count is
     of characters in the source text.  This means that a tab character
     counts as one character in this count and a wide character sequence
     counts as a single character (however many bytes are needed in the
     encoding).

‘-gnatyM’

     ‘Set maximum line length.’

     The length of lines must not exceed the given value ‘nnn’.  The
     maximum value that can be specified is 32767.  If neither style
     option for setting the line length is used, then the default is
     255.  This also controls the maximum length of lexical elements,
     where the only restriction is that they must fit on a single line.

‘-gnatyn’

     ‘Check casing of entities in Standard.’

     Any identifier from Standard must be cased to match the
     presentation in the Ada Reference Manual (for example, ‘Integer’
     and ‘ASCII.NUL’).

‘-gnatyN’

     ‘Turn off all style checks.’

     All style check options are turned off.

‘-gnatyo’

     ‘Check order of subprogram bodies.’

     All subprogram bodies in a given scope (e.g., a package body) must
     be in alphabetical order.  The ordering rule uses normal Ada rules
     for comparing strings, ignoring casing of letters, except that if
     there is a trailing numeric suffix, then the value of this suffix
     is used in the ordering (e.g., Junk2 comes before Junk10).

‘-gnatyO’

     ‘Check that overriding subprograms are explicitly marked as such.’

     This applies to all subprograms of a derived type that override a
     primitive operation of the type, for both tagged and untagged
     types.  In particular, the declaration of a primitive operation of
     a type extension that overrides an inherited operation must carry
     an overriding indicator.  Another case is the declaration of a
     function that overrides a predefined operator (such as an equality
     operator).

‘-gnatyp’

     ‘Check pragma casing.’

     Pragma names must be written in mixed case, that is, the initial
     letter and any letter following an underscore must be uppercase.
     All other letters must be lowercase.  An exception is that
     SPARK_Mode is allowed as an alternative for Spark_Mode.

‘-gnatyr’

     ‘Check references.’

     All identifier references must be cased in the same way as the
     corresponding declaration.  No specific casing style is imposed on
     identifiers.  The only requirement is for consistency of references
     with declarations.

‘-gnatys’

     ‘Check separate specs.’

     Separate declarations (‘specs’) are required for subprograms (a
     body is not allowed to serve as its own declaration).  The only
     exception is that parameterless library level procedures are not
     required to have a separate declaration.  This exception covers the
     most frequent form of main program procedures.

‘-gnatyS’

     ‘Check no statements after then/else.’

     No statements are allowed on the same line as a ‘then’ or ‘else’
     keyword following the keyword in an ‘if’ statement.  ‘or else’ and
     ‘and then’ are not affected, and a special exception allows a
     pragma to appear after ‘else’.

‘-gnatyt’

     ‘Check token spacing.’

     The following token spacing rules are enforced:

        * The keywords ‘abs’ and ‘not’ must be followed by a space.

        * The token ‘=>’ must be surrounded by spaces.

        * The token ‘<>’ must be preceded by a space or a left
          parenthesis.

        * Binary operators other than ‘**’ must be surrounded by spaces.
          There is no restriction on the layout of the ‘**’ binary
          operator.

        * Colon must be surrounded by spaces.

        * Colon-equal (assignment, initialization) must be surrounded by
          spaces.

        * Comma must be the first non-blank character on the line, or be
          immediately preceded by a non-blank character, and must be
          followed by a space.

        * If the token preceding a left parenthesis ends with a letter
          or digit, then a space must separate the two tokens.

        * If the token following a right parenthesis starts with a
          letter or digit, then a space must separate the two tokens.

        * A right parenthesis must either be the first non-blank
          character on a line, or it must be preceded by a non-blank
          character.

        * A semicolon must not be preceded by a space, and must not be
          followed by a non-blank character.

        * A unary plus or minus may not be followed by a space.

        * A vertical bar must be surrounded by spaces.

     Exactly one blank (and no other white space) must appear between a
     ‘not’ token and a following ‘in’ token.

‘-gnatyu’

     ‘Check unnecessary blank lines.’

     Unnecessary blank lines are not allowed.  A blank line is
     considered unnecessary if it appears at the end of the file, or if
     more than one blank line occurs in sequence.

‘-gnatyx’

     ‘Check extra parentheses.’

     Unnecessary extra levels of parentheses (C-style) are not allowed
     around conditions (or selection expressions) in ‘if’, ‘while’,
     ‘case’, and ‘exit’ statements, as well as part of ranges.

‘-gnatyy’

     ‘Set all standard style check options.’

     This is equivalent to ‘gnaty3aAbcefhiklmnprst’, that is all
     checking options enabled with the exception of ‘-gnatyB’,
     ‘-gnatyd’, ‘-gnatyI’, ‘-gnatyLnnn’, ‘-gnatyo’, ‘-gnatyO’,
     ‘-gnatyS’, ‘-gnatyu’, and ‘-gnatyx’.

‘-gnatyz’

     ‘Check extra parentheses (operator precedence).’

     Extra levels of parentheses that are not required by operator
     precedence rules are flagged.  See also ‘-gnatyx’.

‘-gnaty-’

     ‘Remove style check options.’

     This causes any subsequent options in the string to act as
     canceling the corresponding style check option.  To cancel maximum
     nesting level control, use the ‘L’ parameter without any integer
     value after that, because any digit following ‘-’ in the parameter
     string of the ‘-gnaty’ option will be treated as canceling the
     indentation check.  The same is true for the ‘M’ parameter.  ‘y’
     and ‘N’ parameters are not allowed after ‘-’.

‘-gnaty+’

     ‘Enable style check options.’

     This causes any subsequent options in the string to enable the
     corresponding style check option.  That is, it cancels the effect
     of a previous -, if any.

In the above rules, appearing in column one is always permitted, that
is, counts as meeting either a requirement for a required preceding
space, or as meeting a requirement for no preceding space.

Appearing at the end of a line is also always permitted, that is, counts
as meeting either a requirement for a following space, or as meeting a
requirement for no following space.

If any of these style rules is violated, a message is generated giving
details on the violation.  The initial characters of such messages are
always ‘‘(style)’’.  Note that these messages are treated as warning
messages, so they normally do not prevent the generation of an object
file.  The ‘-gnatwe’ switch can be used to treat warning messages,
including style messages, as fatal errors.

The switch ‘-gnaty’ on its own (that is not followed by any letters or
digits) is equivalent to the use of ‘-gnatyy’ as described above, that
is all built-in standard style check options are enabled.

The switch ‘-gnatyN’ clears any previously set style checks.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Run-Time Checks,  Next: Using gcc for Syntax Checking,  Prev: Style Checking,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.7 Run-Time Checks
---------------------

By default, the following checks are suppressed: stack overflow checks,
and checks for access before elaboration on subprogram calls.  All other
checks, including overflow checks, range checks and array bounds checks,
are turned on by default.  The following ‘gcc’ switches refine this
default behavior.

‘-gnatp’

     This switch causes the unit to be compiled as though ‘pragma
     Suppress (All_checks)’ had been present in the source.  Validity
     checks are also eliminated (in other words ‘-gnatp’ also implies
     ‘-gnatVn’.  Use this switch to improve the performance of the code
     at the expense of safety in the presence of invalid data or program
     bugs.

     Note that when checks are suppressed, the compiler is allowed, but
     not required, to omit the checking code.  If the run-time cost of
     the checking code is zero or near-zero, the compiler will generate
     it even if checks are suppressed.  In particular, if the compiler
     can prove that a certain check will necessarily fail, it will
     generate code to do an unconditional ‘raise’, even if checks are
     suppressed.  The compiler warns in this case.  Another case in
     which checks may not be eliminated is when they are embedded in
     certain run-time routines such as math library routines.

     Of course, run-time checks are omitted whenever the compiler can
     prove that they will not fail, whether or not checks are
     suppressed.

     Note that if you suppress a check that would have failed, program
     execution is erroneous, which means the behavior is totally
     unpredictable.  The program might crash, or print wrong answers, or
     do anything else.  It might even do exactly what you wanted it to
     do (and then it might start failing mysteriously next week or next
     year).  The compiler will generate code based on the assumption
     that the condition being checked is true, which can result in
     erroneous execution if that assumption is wrong.

     The checks subject to suppression include all the checks defined by
     the Ada standard, the additional implementation defined checks
     ‘Alignment_Check’, ‘Duplicated_Tag_Check’, ‘Predicate_Check’,
     ‘Container_Checks’, ‘Tampering_Check’, and ‘Validity_Check’, as
     well as any checks introduced using ‘pragma Check_Name’.  Note that
     ‘Atomic_Synchronization’ is not automatically suppressed by use of
     this option.

     If the code depends on certain checks being active, you can use
     pragma ‘Unsuppress’ either as a configuration pragma or as a local
     pragma to make sure that a specified check is performed even if
     ‘gnatp’ is specified.

     The ‘-gnatp’ switch has no effect if a subsequent ‘-gnat-p’ switch
     appears.

‘-gnat-p’

     This switch cancels the effect of a previous ‘gnatp’ switch.

‘-gnato??’

     This switch controls the mode used for computing intermediate
     arithmetic integer operations, and also enables overflow checking.
     For a full description of overflow mode and checking control, see
     the ‘Overflow Check Handling in GNAT’ appendix in this User’s
     Guide.

     Overflow checks are always enabled by this switch.  The argument
     controls the mode, using the codes

     ‘1 = STRICT’

          In STRICT mode, intermediate operations are always done using
          the base type, and overflow checking ensures that the result
          is within the base type range.

     ‘2 = MINIMIZED’

          In MINIMIZED mode, overflows in intermediate operations are
          avoided where possible by using a larger integer type for the
          computation (typically ‘Long_Long_Integer’).  Overflow
          checking ensures that the result fits in this larger integer
          type.

     ‘3 = ELIMINATED’

          In ELIMINATED mode, overflows in intermediate operations are
          avoided by using multi-precision arithmetic.  In this case,
          overflow checking has no effect on intermediate operations
          (since overflow is impossible).

     If two digits are present after ‘-gnato’ then the first digit sets
     the mode for expressions outside assertions, and the second digit
     sets the mode for expressions within assertions.  Here assertions
     is used in the technical sense (which includes for example
     precondition and postcondition expressions).

     If one digit is present, the corresponding mode is applicable to
     both expressions within and outside assertion expressions.

     If no digits are present, the default is to enable overflow checks
     and set STRICT mode for both kinds of expressions.  This is
     compatible with the use of ‘-gnato’ in previous versions of GNAT.

     Note that the ‘-gnato??’ switch does not affect the code generated
     for any floating-point operations; it applies only to integer
     semantics.  For floating-point, GNAT has the ‘Machine_Overflows’
     attribute set to ‘False’ and the normal mode of operation is to
     generate IEEE NaN and infinite values on overflow or invalid
     operations (such as dividing 0.0 by 0.0).

     The reason that we distinguish overflow checking from other kinds
     of range constraint checking is that a failure of an overflow
     check, unlike for example the failure of a range check, can result
     in an incorrect value, but cannot cause random memory destruction
     (like an out of range subscript), or a wild jump (from an out of
     range case value).  Overflow checking is also quite expensive in
     time and space, since in general it requires the use of double
     length arithmetic.

     Note again that the default is ‘-gnato11’ (equivalent to
     ‘-gnato1’), so overflow checking is performed in STRICT mode by
     default.

‘-gnatE’

     Enables dynamic checks for access-before-elaboration on subprogram
     calls and generic instantiations.  Note that ‘-gnatE’ is not
     necessary for safety, because in the default mode, GNAT ensures
     statically that the checks would not fail.  For full details of the
     effect and use of this switch, *note Compiling with gcc: c9.

‘-fstack-check’

     Activates stack overflow checking.  For full details of the effect
     and use of this switch see *note Stack Overflow Checking: e7.

The setting of these switches only controls the default setting of the
checks.  You may modify them using either ‘Suppress’ (to remove checks)
or ‘Unsuppress’ (to add back suppressed checks) pragmas in the program
source.

4.3.8 Using ‘gcc’ for Syntax Checking
-------------------------------------

‘-gnats’

     The ‘s’ stands for ‘syntax’.

     Run GNAT in syntax checking only mode.  For example, the command

          $ gcc -c -gnats x.adb

     compiles file ‘x.adb’ in syntax-check-only mode.  You can check a
     series of files in a single command , and can use wildcards to
     specify such a group of files.  Note that you must specify the ‘-c’
     (compile only) flag in addition to the ‘-gnats’ flag.

     You may use other switches in conjunction with ‘-gnats’.  In
     particular, ‘-gnatl’ and ‘-gnatv’ are useful to control the format
     of any generated error messages.

     When the source file is empty or contains only empty lines and/or
     comments, the output is a warning:

          $ gcc -c -gnats -x ada toto.txt
          toto.txt:1:01: warning: empty file, contains no compilation units
          $

     Otherwise, the output is simply the error messages, if any.  No
     object file or ALI file is generated by a syntax-only compilation.
     Also, no units other than the one specified are accessed.  For
     example, if a unit ‘X’ ‘with’s a unit ‘Y’, compiling unit ‘X’ in
     syntax check only mode does not access the source file containing
     unit ‘Y’.

     Normally, GNAT allows only a single unit in a source file.
     However, this restriction does not apply in syntax-check-only mode,
     and it is possible to check a file containing multiple compilation
     units concatenated together.  This is primarily used by the
     ‘gnatchop’ utility (*note Renaming Files with gnatchop: 1d.).

4.3.9 Using ‘gcc’ for Semantic Checking
---------------------------------------

‘-gnatc’

     The ‘c’ stands for ‘check’.  Causes the compiler to operate in
     semantic check mode, with full checking for all illegalities
     specified in the Ada Reference Manual, but without generation of
     any object code (no object file is generated).

     Because dependent files must be accessed, you must follow the GNAT
     semantic restrictions on file structuring to operate in this mode:

        * The needed source files must be accessible (see *note Search
          Paths and the Run-Time Library (RTL): 73.).

        * Each file must contain only one compilation unit.

        * The file name and unit name must match (*note File Naming
          Rules: 3b.).

     The output consists of error messages as appropriate.  No object
     file is generated.  An ‘ALI’ file is generated for use in the
     context of cross-reference tools, but this file is marked as not
     being suitable for binding (since no object file is generated).
     The checking corresponds exactly to the notion of legality in the
     Ada Reference Manual.

     Any unit can be compiled in semantics-checking-only mode, including
     units that would not normally be compiled (subunits, and
     specifications where a separate body is present).

4.3.10 Compiling Different Versions of Ada
------------------------------------------

The switches described in this section allow you to explicitly specify
the version of the Ada language that your programs are written in.  The
default mode is Ada 2012, but you can also specify Ada 95, Ada 2005
mode, or indicate Ada 83 compatibility mode.

‘-gnat83’ (Ada 83 Compatibility Mode)

     Although GNAT is primarily an Ada 95 / Ada 2005 compiler, this
     switch specifies that the program is to be compiled in Ada 83 mode.
     With ‘-gnat83’, GNAT rejects most post-Ada 83 extensions and
     applies Ada 83 semantics where this can be done easily.  It is not
     possible to guarantee this switch does a perfect job; some subtle
     tests, such as are found in earlier ACVC tests (and that have been
     removed from the ACATS suite for Ada 95), might not compile
     correctly.  Nevertheless, this switch may be useful in some
     circumstances, for example where, due to contractual reasons,
     existing code needs to be maintained using only Ada 83 features.

     With few exceptions (most notably the need to use ‘<>’ on
     unconstrained generic formal parameters, the use of the new Ada 95
     / Ada 2005 reserved words, and the use of packages with optional
     bodies), it is not necessary to specify the ‘-gnat83’ switch when
     compiling Ada 83 programs, because, with rare exceptions, Ada 95
     and Ada 2005 are upwardly compatible with Ada 83.  Thus a correct
     Ada 83 program is usually also a correct program in these later
     versions of the language standard.  For further information please
     refer to the ‘Compatibility and Porting Guide’ chapter in the ‘GNAT
     Reference Manual’.

‘-gnat95’ (Ada 95 mode)

     This switch directs the compiler to implement the Ada 95 version of
     the language.  Since Ada 95 is almost completely upwards compatible
     with Ada 83, Ada 83 programs may generally be compiled using this
     switch (see the description of the ‘-gnat83’ switch for further
     information about Ada 83 mode).  If an Ada 2005 program is compiled
     in Ada 95 mode, uses of the new Ada 2005 features will cause error
     messages or warnings.

     This switch also can be used to cancel the effect of a previous
     ‘-gnat83’, ‘-gnat05/2005’, or ‘-gnat12/2012’ switch earlier in the
     command line.

‘-gnat05’ or ‘-gnat2005’ (Ada 2005 mode)

     This switch directs the compiler to implement the Ada 2005 version
     of the language, as documented in the official Ada standards
     document.  Since Ada 2005 is almost completely upwards compatible
     with Ada 95 (and thus also with Ada 83), Ada 83 and Ada 95 programs
     may generally be compiled using this switch (see the description of
     the ‘-gnat83’ and ‘-gnat95’ switches for further information).

‘-gnat12’ or ‘-gnat2012’ (Ada 2012 mode)

     This switch directs the compiler to implement the Ada 2012 version
     of the language (also the default).  Since Ada 2012 is almost
     completely upwards compatible with Ada 2005 (and thus also with Ada
     83, and Ada 95), Ada 83 and Ada 95 programs may generally be
     compiled using this switch (see the description of the ‘-gnat83’,
     ‘-gnat95’, and ‘-gnat05/2005’ switches for further information).

‘-gnat2022’ (Ada 2022 mode)

     This switch directs the compiler to implement the Ada 2022 version
     of the language.

‘-gnatX0’ (Enable GNAT Extensions)

     This switch directs the compiler to implement the latest version of
     the language (currently Ada 2022) and also to enable certain GNAT
     implementation extensions that are not part of any Ada standard.
     For a full list of these extensions, see the GNAT reference manual,
     ‘Pragma Extensions_Allowed’.

‘-gnatX’ (Enable core GNAT Extensions)

     This switch is similar to -gnatX0 except that only some, not all,
     of the GNAT-defined language extensions are enabled.  For a list of
     the extensions enabled by this switch, see the GNAT reference
     manual ‘Pragma Extensions_Allowed’ and the description of that
     pragma’s “On” (as opposed to “All”) argument.

4.3.11 Character Set Control
----------------------------

‘-gnati`c'’

     Normally GNAT recognizes the Latin-1 character set in source
     program identifiers, as described in the Ada Reference Manual.
     This switch causes GNAT to recognize alternate character sets in
     identifiers.  ‘c’ is a single character indicating the character
     set, as follows:

     ‘1’            ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘2’            ISO 8859-2 (Latin-2) letters allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘3’            ISO 8859-3 (Latin-3) letters allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘4’            ISO 8859-4 (Latin-4) letters allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘5’            ISO 8859-5 (Cyrillic) letters allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘9’            ISO 8859-15 (Latin-9) letters allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘p’            IBM PC letters (code page 437) allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘8’            IBM PC letters (code page 850) allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘f’            Full upper-half codes allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘n’            No upper-half codes allowed in identifiers
                    
                    
     ‘w’            Wide-character codes (that is, codes greater than 255)
                    allowed in identifiers
                    

     See *note Foreign Language Representation: 23. for full details on
     the implementation of these character sets.

‘-gnatW`e'’

     Specify the method of encoding for wide characters.  ‘e’ is one of
     the following:

     ‘h’            Hex encoding (brackets coding also recognized)
                    
                    
     ‘u’            Upper half encoding (brackets encoding also recognized)
                    
                    
     ‘s’            Shift/JIS encoding (brackets encoding also recognized)
                    
                    
     ‘e’            EUC encoding (brackets encoding also recognized)
                    
                    
     ‘8’            UTF-8 encoding (brackets encoding also recognized)
                    
                    
     ‘b’            Brackets encoding only (default value)
                    

     For full details on these encoding methods see *note Wide_Character
     Encodings: 37.  Note that brackets coding is always accepted, even
     if one of the other options is specified, so for example ‘-gnatW8’
     specifies that both brackets and UTF-8 encodings will be
     recognized.  The units that are with’ed directly or indirectly will
     be scanned using the specified representation scheme, and so if one
     of the non-brackets scheme is used, it must be used consistently
     throughout the program.  However, since brackets encoding is always
     recognized, it may be conveniently used in standard libraries,
     allowing these libraries to be used with any of the available
     coding schemes.

     Note that brackets encoding only applies to program text.  Within
     comments, brackets are considered to be normal graphic characters,
     and bracket sequences are never recognized as wide characters.

     If no ‘-gnatW?’ parameter is present, then the default
     representation is normally Brackets encoding only.  However, if the
     first three characters of the file are 16#EF# 16#BB# 16#BF# (the
     standard byte order mark or BOM for UTF-8), then these three
     characters are skipped and the default representation for the file
     is set to UTF-8.

     Note that the wide character representation that is specified
     (explicitly or by default) for the main program also acts as the
     default encoding used for Wide_Text_IO files if not specifically
     overridden by a WCEM form parameter.

When no ‘-gnatW?’ is specified, then characters (other than wide
characters represented using brackets notation) are treated as 8-bit
Latin-1 codes.  The codes recognized are the Latin-1 graphic characters,
and ASCII format effectors (CR, LF, HT, VT). Other lower half control
characters in the range 16#00#..16#1F# are not accepted in program text
or in comments.  Upper half control characters (16#80#..16#9F#) are
rejected in program text, but allowed and ignored in comments.  Note in
particular that the Next Line (NEL) character whose encoding is 16#85#
is not recognized as an end of line in this default mode.  If your
source program contains instances of the NEL character used as a line
terminator, you must use UTF-8 encoding for the whole source program.
In default mode, all lines must be ended by a standard end of line
sequence (CR, CR/LF, or LF).

Note that the convention of simply accepting all upper half characters
in comments means that programs that use standard ASCII for program
text, but UTF-8 encoding for comments are accepted in default mode,
providing that the comments are ended by an appropriate (CR, or CR/LF,
or LF) line terminator.  This is a common mode for many programs with
foreign language comments.

4.3.12 File Naming Control
--------------------------

‘-gnatk`n'’

     Activates file name ‘krunching’.  ‘n’, a decimal integer in the
     range 1-999, indicates the maximum allowable length of a file name
     (not including the ‘.ads’ or ‘.adb’ extension).  The default is not
     to enable file name krunching.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Subprogram Inlining Control,  Next: Auxiliary Output Control,  Prev: File Naming Control,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.13 Subprogram Inlining Control
----------------------------------

‘-gnatn[12]’

     The ‘n’ here is intended to suggest the first syllable of the word
     ‘inline’.  GNAT recognizes and processes ‘Inline’ pragmas.
     However, for inlining to actually occur, optimization must be
     enabled and, by default, inlining of subprograms across units is
     not performed.  If you want to additionally enable inlining of
     subprograms specified by pragma ‘Inline’ across units, you must
     also specify this switch.

     In the absence of this switch, GNAT does not attempt inlining
     across units and does not access the bodies of subprograms for
     which ‘pragma Inline’ is specified if they are not in the current
     unit.

     You can optionally specify the inlining level: 1 for moderate
     inlining across units, which is a good compromise between
     compilation times and performances at run time, or 2 for full
     inlining across units, which may bring about longer compilation
     times.  If no inlining level is specified, the compiler will pick
     it based on the optimization level: 1 for ‘-O1’, ‘-O2’ or ‘-Os’ and
     2 for ‘-O3’.

     If you specify this switch the compiler will access these bodies,
     creating an extra source dependency for the resulting object file,
     and where possible, the call will be inlined.  For further details
     on when inlining is possible see *note Inlining of Subprograms:
     102.

‘-gnatN’

     This switch activates front-end inlining which also generates
     additional dependencies.

     When using a gcc-based back end, then the use of ‘-gnatN’ is
     deprecated, and the use of ‘-gnatn’ is preferred.  Historically
     front end inlining was more extensive than the gcc back end
     inlining, but that is no longer the case.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Auxiliary Output Control,  Next: Debugging Control,  Prev: Subprogram Inlining Control,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.14 Auxiliary Output Control
-------------------------------

‘-gnatu’

     Print a list of units required by this compilation on ‘stdout’.
     The listing includes all units on which the unit being compiled
     depends either directly or indirectly.

‘-pass-exit-codes’

     If this switch is not used, the exit code returned by ‘gcc’ when
     compiling multiple files indicates whether all source files have
     been successfully used to generate object files or not.

     When ‘-pass-exit-codes’ is used, ‘gcc’ exits with an extended exit
     status and allows an integrated development environment to better
     react to a compilation failure.  Those exit status are:

     ‘5’            There was an error in at least one source file.
                    
                    
     ‘3’            At least one source file did not generate an object file.
                    
                    
     ‘2’            The compiler died unexpectedly (internal error for example).
                    
                    
     ‘0’            An object file has been generated for every source file.
                    


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Debugging Control,  Next: Exception Handling Control,  Prev: Auxiliary Output Control,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.15 Debugging Control
------------------------

‘-gnatd`x'’

     Activate internal debugging switches.  ‘x’ is a letter or digit, or
     string of letters or digits, which specifies the type of debugging
     outputs desired.  Normally these are used only for internal
     development or system debugging purposes.  You can find full
     documentation for these switches in the body of the ‘Debug’ unit in
     the compiler source file ‘debug.adb’.

‘-gnatG[=`nn']’

     This switch causes the compiler to generate auxiliary output
     containing a pseudo-source listing of the generated expanded code.
     Like most Ada compilers, GNAT works by first transforming the high
     level Ada code into lower level constructs.  For example, tasking
     operations are transformed into calls to the tasking run-time
     routines.  A unique capability of GNAT is to list this expanded
     code in a form very close to normal Ada source.  This is very
     useful in understanding the implications of various Ada usage on
     the efficiency of the generated code.  There are many cases in Ada
     (e.g., the use of controlled types), where simple Ada statements
     can generate a lot of run-time code.  By using ‘-gnatG’ you can
     identify these cases, and consider whether it may be desirable to
     modify the coding approach to improve efficiency.

     The optional parameter ‘nn’ if present after -gnatG specifies an
     alternative maximum line length that overrides the normal default
     of 72.  This value is in the range 40-999999, values less than 40
     being silently reset to 40.  The equal sign is optional.

     The format of the output is very similar to standard Ada source,
     and is easily understood by an Ada programmer.  The following
     special syntactic additions correspond to low level features used
     in the generated code that do not have any exact analogies in pure
     Ada source form.  The following is a partial list of these special
     constructions.  See the spec of package ‘Sprint’ in file
     ‘sprint.ads’ for a full list.

     If the switch ‘-gnatL’ is used in conjunction with ‘-gnatG’, then
     the original source lines are interspersed in the expanded source
     (as comment lines with the original line number).

     ‘new XXX [storage_pool = YYY]’

          Shows the storage pool being used for an allocator.

     ‘at end PROCEDURE-NAME;’

          Shows the finalization (cleanup) procedure for a scope.

     ‘(if EXPR then EXPR else EXPR)’

          Conditional expression equivalent to the ‘x?y:z’ construction
          in C.

     ‘TARGET^(SOURCE)’

          A conversion with floating-point truncation instead of
          rounding.

     ‘TARGET?(SOURCE)’

          A conversion that bypasses normal Ada semantic checking.  In
          particular enumeration types and fixed-point types are treated
          simply as integers.

     ‘TARGET?^(SOURCE)’

          Combines the above two cases.

     ‘X #/ Y’

     ‘X #mod Y’

     ‘X # Y’

     ‘X #rem Y’

          A division or multiplication of fixed-point values which are
          treated as integers without any kind of scaling.

     ‘free EXPR [storage_pool = XXX]’

          Shows the storage pool associated with a ‘free’ statement.

     ‘[subtype or type declaration]’

          Used to list an equivalent declaration for an internally
          generated type that is referenced elsewhere in the listing.

     ‘freeze TYPE-NAME [ACTIONS]’

          Shows the point at which ‘type-name’ is frozen, with possible
          associated actions to be performed at the freeze point.

     ‘reference ITYPE’

          Reference (and hence definition) to internal type ‘itype’.

     ‘FUNCTION-NAME! (ARG, ARG, ARG)’

          Intrinsic function call.

     ‘LABEL-NAME : label’

          Declaration of label ‘labelname’.

     ‘#$ SUBPROGRAM-NAME’

          An implicit call to a run-time support routine (to meet the
          requirement of H.3.1(9) in a convenient manner).

     ‘EXPR && EXPR && EXPR ... && EXPR’

          A multiple concatenation (same effect as ‘expr’ & ‘expr’ &
          ‘expr’, but handled more efficiently).

     ‘[constraint_error]’

          Raise the ‘Constraint_Error’ exception.

     ‘EXPRESSION'reference’

          A pointer to the result of evaluating {expression}.

     ‘TARGET-TYPE!(SOURCE-EXPRESSION)’

          An unchecked conversion of ‘source-expression’ to
          ‘target-type’.

     ‘[NUMERATOR/DENOMINATOR]’

          Used to represent internal real literals (that) have no exact
          representation in base 2-16 (for example, the result of
          compile time evaluation of the expression 1.0/27.0).

‘-gnatD[=nn]’

     When used in conjunction with ‘-gnatG’, this switch causes the
     expanded source, as described above for ‘-gnatG’ to be written to
     files with names ‘xxx.dg’, where ‘xxx’ is the normal file name,
     instead of to the standard output file.  For example, if the source
     file name is ‘hello.adb’, then a file ‘hello.adb.dg’ will be
     written.  The debugging information generated by the ‘gcc’ ‘-g’
     switch will refer to the generated ‘xxx.dg’ file.  This allows you
     to do source level debugging using the generated code which is
     sometimes useful for complex code, for example to find out exactly
     which part of a complex construction raised an exception.  This
     switch also suppresses generation of cross-reference information
     (see ‘-gnatx’) since otherwise the cross-reference information
     would refer to the ‘.dg’ file, which would cause confusion since
     this is not the original source file.

     Note that ‘-gnatD’ actually implies ‘-gnatG’ automatically, so it
     is not necessary to give both options.  In other words ‘-gnatD’ is
     equivalent to ‘-gnatDG’).

     If the switch ‘-gnatL’ is used in conjunction with ‘-gnatDG’, then
     the original source lines are interspersed in the expanded source
     (as comment lines with the original line number).

     The optional parameter ‘nn’ if present after -gnatD specifies an
     alternative maximum line length that overrides the normal default
     of 72.  This value is in the range 40-999999, values less than 40
     being silently reset to 40.  The equal sign is optional.

‘-gnatr’

     This switch causes pragma Restrictions to be treated as
     Restriction_Warnings so that violation of restrictions causes
     warnings rather than illegalities.  This is useful during the
     development process when new restrictions are added or
     investigated.  The switch also causes pragma Profile to be treated
     as Profile_Warnings, and pragma Restricted_Run_Time and pragma
     Ravenscar set restriction warnings rather than restrictions.

‘-gnatR[0|1|2|3|4][e][j][m][s]’

     This switch controls output from the compiler of a listing showing
     representation information for declared types, objects and
     subprograms.  For ‘-gnatR0’, no information is output (equivalent
     to omitting the ‘-gnatR’ switch).  For ‘-gnatR1’ (which is the
     default, so ‘-gnatR’ with no parameter has the same effect), size
     and alignment information is listed for declared array and record
     types.

     For ‘-gnatR2’, size and alignment information is listed for all
     declared types and objects.  The ‘Linker_Section’ is also listed
     for any entity for which the ‘Linker_Section’ is set explicitly or
     implicitly (the latter case occurs for objects of a type for which
     a ‘Linker_Section’ is set).

     For ‘-gnatR3’, symbolic expressions for values that are computed at
     run time for records are included.  These symbolic expressions have
     a mostly obvious format with #n being used to represent the value
     of the n’th discriminant.  See source files ‘repinfo.ads/adb’ in
     the GNAT sources for full details on the format of ‘-gnatR3’
     output.

     For ‘-gnatR4’, information for relevant compiler-generated types is
     also listed, i.e.  when they are structurally part of other
     declared types and objects.

     If the switch is followed by an ‘e’ (e.g.  ‘-gnatR2e’), then
     extended representation information for record sub-components of
     records is included.

     If the switch is followed by an ‘m’ (e.g.  ‘-gnatRm’), then
     subprogram conventions and parameter passing mechanisms for all the
     subprograms are included.

     If the switch is followed by a ‘j’ (e.g., ‘-gnatRj’), then the
     output is in the JSON data interchange format specified by the
     ECMA-404 standard.  The semantic description of this JSON output is
     available in the specification of the Repinfo unit present in the
     compiler sources.

     If the switch is followed by an ‘s’ (e.g., ‘-gnatR3s’), then the
     output is to a file with the name ‘file.rep’ where ‘file’ is the
     name of the corresponding source file, except if ‘j’ is also
     specified, in which case the file name is ‘file.json’.

     Note that it is possible for record components to have zero size.
     In this case, the component clause uses an obvious extension of
     permitted Ada syntax, for example ‘at 0 range 0 .. -1’.

‘-gnatS’

     The use of the switch ‘-gnatS’ for an Ada compilation will cause
     the compiler to output a representation of package Standard in a
     form very close to standard Ada.  It is not quite possible to do
     this entirely in standard Ada (since new numeric base types cannot
     be created in standard Ada), but the output is easily readable to
     any Ada programmer, and is useful to determine the characteristics
     of target dependent types in package Standard.

‘-gnatx’

     Normally the compiler generates full cross-referencing information
     in the ‘ALI’ file.  This information is used by a number of tools.
     The ‘-gnatx’ switch suppresses this information.  This saves some
     space and may slightly speed up compilation, but means that tools
     depending on this information cannot be used.

‘-fgnat-encodings=[all|gdb|minimal]’

     This switch controls the balance between GNAT encodings and
     standard DWARF emitted in the debug information.

     Historically, old debug formats like stabs were not powerful enough
     to express some Ada types (for instance, variant records or
     fixed-point types).  To work around this, GNAT introduced
     proprietary encodings that embed the missing information (“GNAT
     encodings”).

     Recent versions of the DWARF debug information format are now able
     to correctly describe most of these Ada constructs (“standard
     DWARF”).  As third-party tools started to use this format, GNAT has
     been enhanced to generate it.  However, most tools (including GDB)
     are still relying on GNAT encodings.

     To support all tools, GNAT needs to be versatile about the balance
     between generation of GNAT encodings and standard DWARF. This is
     what ‘-fgnat-encodings’ is about.

        * ‘=all’: Emit all GNAT encodings, and then emit as much
          standard DWARF as possible so it does not conflict with GNAT
          encodings.

        * ‘=gdb’: Emit as much standard DWARF as possible as long as the
          current GDB handles it.  Emit GNAT encodings for the rest.

        * ‘=minimal’: Emit as much standard DWARF as possible and emit
          GNAT encodings for the rest.

4.3.16 Exception Handling Control
---------------------------------

GNAT uses two methods for handling exceptions at run time.  The
‘setjmp/longjmp’ method saves the context when entering a frame with an
exception handler.  Then when an exception is raised, the context can be
restored immediately, without the need for tracing stack frames.  This
method provides very fast exception propagation, but introduces
significant overhead for the use of exception handlers, even if no
exception is raised.

The other approach is called ‘zero cost’ exception handling.  With this
method, the compiler builds static tables to describe the exception
ranges.  No dynamic code is required when entering a frame containing an
exception handler.  When an exception is raised, the tables are used to
control a back trace of the subprogram invocation stack to locate the
required exception handler.  This method has considerably poorer
performance for the propagation of exceptions, but there is no overhead
for exception handlers if no exception is raised.  Note that in this
mode and in the context of mixed Ada and C/C++ programming, to propagate
an exception through a C/C++ code, the C/C++ code must be compiled with
the ‘-funwind-tables’ GCC’s option.

The following switches may be used to control which of the two exception
handling methods is used.

‘--RTS=sjlj’

     This switch causes the setjmp/longjmp run-time (when available) to
     be used for exception handling.  If the default mechanism for the
     target is zero cost exceptions, then this switch can be used to
     modify this default, and must be used for all units in the
     partition.  This option is rarely used.  One case in which it may
     be advantageous is if you have an application where exception
     raising is common and the overall performance of the application is
     improved by favoring exception propagation.

‘--RTS=zcx’

     This switch causes the zero cost approach to be used for exception
     handling.  If this is the default mechanism for the target (see
     below), then this switch is unneeded.  If the default mechanism for
     the target is setjmp/longjmp exceptions, then this switch can be
     used to modify this default, and must be used for all units in the
     partition.  This option can only be used if the zero cost approach
     is available for the target in use, otherwise it will generate an
     error.

The same option ‘--RTS’ must be used both for ‘gcc’ and ‘gnatbind’.
Passing this option to ‘gnatmake’ (*note Switches for gnatmake: d0.)
will ensure the required consistency through the compilation and binding
steps.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Units to Sources Mapping Files,  Next: Code Generation Control,  Prev: Exception Handling Control,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.17 Units to Sources Mapping Files
-------------------------------------

‘-gnatem=`path'’

     A mapping file is a way to communicate to the compiler two
     mappings: from unit names to file names (without any directory
     information) and from file names to path names (with full directory
     information).  These mappings are used by the compiler to
     short-circuit the path search.

     The use of mapping files is not required for correct operation of
     the compiler, but mapping files can improve efficiency,
     particularly when sources are read over a slow network connection.
     In normal operation, you need not be concerned with the format or
     use of mapping files, and the ‘-gnatem’ switch is not a switch that
     you would use explicitly.  It is intended primarily for use by
     automatic tools such as ‘gnatmake’ running under the project file
     facility.  The description here of the format of mapping files is
     provided for completeness and for possible use by other tools.

     A mapping file is a sequence of sets of three lines.  In each set,
     the first line is the unit name, in lower case, with ‘%s’ appended
     for specs and ‘%b’ appended for bodies; the second line is the file
     name; and the third line is the path name.

     Example:

          main%b
          main.2.ada
          /gnat/project1/sources/main.2.ada

     When the switch ‘-gnatem’ is specified, the compiler will create in
     memory the two mappings from the specified file.  If there is any
     problem (nonexistent file, truncated file or duplicate entries), no
     mapping will be created.

     Several ‘-gnatem’ switches may be specified; however, only the last
     one on the command line will be taken into account.

     When using a project file, ‘gnatmake’ creates a temporary mapping
     file and communicates it to the compiler using this switch.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Code Generation Control,  Prev: Units to Sources Mapping Files,  Up: Compiler Switches

4.3.18 Code Generation Control
------------------------------

The GCC technology provides a wide range of target dependent ‘-m’
switches for controlling details of code generation with respect to
different versions of architectures.  This includes variations in
instruction sets (e.g., different members of the power pc family), and
different requirements for optimal arrangement of instructions (e.g.,
different members of the x86 family).  The list of available ‘-m’
switches may be found in the GCC documentation.

Use of these ‘-m’ switches may in some cases result in improved code
performance.

The GNAT technology is tested and qualified without any ‘-m’ switches,
so generally the most reliable approach is to avoid the use of these
switches.  However, we generally expect most of these switches to work
successfully with GNAT, and many customers have reported successful use
of these options.

Our general advice is to avoid the use of ‘-m’ switches unless special
needs lead to requirements in this area.  In particular, there is no
point in using ‘-m’ switches to improve performance unless you actually
see a performance improvement.

4.5 Binding with ‘gnatbind’
===========================

This chapter describes the GNAT binder, ‘gnatbind’, which is used to
bind compiled GNAT objects.

The ‘gnatbind’ program performs four separate functions:

   * Checks that a program is consistent, in accordance with the rules
     in Chapter 10 of the Ada Reference Manual.  In particular, error
     messages are generated if a program uses inconsistent versions of a
     given unit.

   * Checks that an acceptable order of elaboration exists for the
     program and issues an error message if it cannot find an order of
     elaboration that satisfies the rules in Chapter 10 of the Ada
     Language Manual.

   * Generates a main program incorporating the given elaboration order.
     This program is a small Ada package (body and spec) that must be
     subsequently compiled using the GNAT compiler.  The necessary
     compilation step is usually performed automatically by ‘gnatlink’.
     The two most important functions of this program are to call the
     elaboration routines of units in an appropriate order and to call
     the main program.

   * Determines the set of object files required by the given main
     program.  This information is output in the forms of comments in
     the generated program, to be read by the ‘gnatlink’ utility used to
     link the Ada application.

4.5.1 Running ‘gnatbind’
------------------------

The form of the ‘gnatbind’ command is

     $ gnatbind [ switches ] mainprog[.ali] [ switches ]

where ‘mainprog.adb’ is the Ada file containing the main program unit
body.  ‘gnatbind’ constructs an Ada package in two files whose names are
‘b~mainprog.ads’, and ‘b~mainprog.adb’.  For example, if given the
parameter ‘hello.ali’, for a main program contained in file ‘hello.adb’,
the binder output files would be ‘b~hello.ads’ and ‘b~hello.adb’.

When doing consistency checking, the binder takes into consideration any
source files it can locate.  For example, if the binder determines that
the given main program requires the package ‘Pack’, whose ‘.ALI’ file is
‘pack.ali’ and whose corresponding source spec file is ‘pack.ads’, it
attempts to locate the source file ‘pack.ads’ (using the same search
path conventions as previously described for the ‘gcc’ command).  If it
can locate this source file, it checks that the time stamps or source
checksums of the source and its references to in ‘ALI’ files match.  In
other words, any ‘ALI’ files that mentions this spec must have resulted
from compiling this version of the source file (or in the case where the
source checksums match, a version close enough that the difference does
not matter).

The effect of this consistency checking, which includes source files, is
that the binder ensures that the program is consistent with the latest
version of the source files that can be located at bind time.  Editing a
source file without compiling files that depend on the source file cause
error messages to be generated by the binder.

For example, suppose you have a main program ‘hello.adb’ and a package
‘P’, from file ‘p.ads’ and you perform the following steps:

   * Enter ‘gcc -c hello.adb’ to compile the main program.

   * Enter ‘gcc -c p.ads’ to compile package ‘P’.

   * Edit file ‘p.ads’.

   * Enter ‘gnatbind hello’.

At this point, the file ‘p.ali’ contains an out-of-date time stamp
because the file ‘p.ads’ has been edited.  The attempt at binding fails,
and the binder generates the following error messages:

     error: "hello.adb" must be recompiled ("p.ads" has been modified)
     error: "p.ads" has been modified and must be recompiled

Now both files must be recompiled as indicated, and then the bind can
succeed, generating a main program.  You need not normally be concerned
with the contents of this file, but for reference purposes a sample
binder output file is given in *note Example of Binder Output File: e.

In most normal usage, the default mode of ‘gnatbind’ which is to
generate the main package in Ada, as described in the previous section.
In particular, this means that any Ada programmer can read and
understand the generated main program.  It can also be debugged just
like any other Ada code provided the ‘-g’ switch is used for ‘gnatbind’
and ‘gnatlink’.

4.5.2 Switches for ‘gnatbind’
-----------------------------

The following switches are available with ‘gnatbind’; details will be
presented in subsequent sections.

‘--version’

     Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

‘--help’

     If ‘--version’ was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
     all other options.

‘-a’

     Indicates that, if supported by the platform, the adainit procedure
     should be treated as an initialisation routine by the linker (a
     constructor).  This is intended to be used by the Project Manager
     to automatically initialize shared Stand-Alone Libraries.

‘-aO’

     Specify directory to be searched for ALI files.

‘-aI’

     Specify directory to be searched for source file.

‘-A[=`filename']’

     Output ALI list (to standard output or to the named file).

‘-b’

     Generate brief messages to ‘stderr’ even if verbose mode set.

‘-c’

     Check only, no generation of binder output file.

‘-d`nn'[k|m]’

     This switch can be used to change the default task stack size value
     to a specified size ‘nn’, which is expressed in bytes by default,
     or in kilobytes when suffixed with ‘k’ or in megabytes when
     suffixed with ‘m’.  In the absence of a ‘[k|m]’ suffix, this switch
     is equivalent, in effect, to completing all task specs with

          pragma Storage_Size (nn);

     When they do not already have such a pragma.

‘-D`nn'[k|m]’

     Set the default secondary stack size to ‘nn’.  The suffix indicates
     whether the size is in bytes (no suffix), kilobytes (‘k’ suffix) or
     megabytes (‘m’ suffix).

     The secondary stack holds objects of unconstrained types that are
     returned by functions, for example unconstrained Strings.  The size
     of the secondary stack can be dynamic or fixed depending on the
     target.

     For most targets, the secondary stack grows on demand and is
     implemented as a chain of blocks in the heap.  In this case, the
     default secondary stack size determines the initial size of the
     secondary stack for each task and the smallest amount the secondary
     stack can grow by.

     For Light, Light-Tasking, and Embedded run-times the size of the
     secondary stack is fixed.  This switch can be used to change the
     default size of these stacks.  The default secondary stack size can
     be overridden on a per-task basis if individual tasks have
     different secondary stack requirements.  This is achieved through
     the Secondary_Stack_Size aspect, which takes the size of the
     secondary stack in bytes.

‘-e’

     Output complete list of elaboration-order dependencies.

‘-Ea’

     Store tracebacks in exception occurrences when the target supports
     it.  The “a” is for “address”; tracebacks will contain hexadecimal
     addresses, unless symbolic tracebacks are enabled.

     See also the packages ‘GNAT.Traceback’ and
     ‘GNAT.Traceback.Symbolic’ for more information.  Note that on x86
     ports, you must not use ‘-fomit-frame-pointer’ ‘gcc’ option.

‘-Es’

     Store tracebacks in exception occurrences when the target supports
     it.  The “s” is for “symbolic”; symbolic tracebacks are enabled.

‘-E’

     Currently the same as ‘-Ea’.

‘-f`elab-order'’

     Force elaboration order.  For further details see *note Elaboration
     Control: 113. and *note Elaboration Order Handling in GNAT: f.

‘-F’

     Force the checks of elaboration flags.  ‘gnatbind’ does not
     normally generate checks of elaboration flags for the main
     executable, except when a Stand-Alone Library is used.  However,
     there are cases when this cannot be detected by gnatbind.  An
     example is importing an interface of a Stand-Alone Library through
     a pragma Import and only specifying through a linker switch this
     Stand-Alone Library.  This switch is used to guarantee that
     elaboration flag checks are generated.

‘-h’

     Output usage (help) information.

‘-H’

     Legacy elaboration order model enabled.  For further details see
     *note Elaboration Order Handling in GNAT: f.

‘-H32’

     Use 32-bit allocations for ‘__gnat_malloc’ (and thus for access
     types).  For further details see *note Dynamic Allocation Control:
     114.

‘-H64’

     Use 64-bit allocations for ‘__gnat_malloc’ (and thus for access
     types).  For further details see *note Dynamic Allocation Control:
     114.

‘-I’

     Specify directory to be searched for source and ALI files.

‘-I-’

     Do not look for sources in the current directory where ‘gnatbind’
     was invoked, and do not look for ALI files in the directory
     containing the ALI file named in the ‘gnatbind’ command line.

‘-k’

     Disable checking of elaboration flags.  When using ‘-n’ either
     explicitly or implicitly, ‘-F’ is also implied, unless ‘-k’ is
     used.  This switch should be used with care and you should ensure
     manually that elaboration routines are not called twice
     unintentionally.

‘-K’

     Give list of linker options specified for link.

‘-l’

     Output chosen elaboration order.

‘-L`xxx'’

     Bind the units for library building.  In this case the ‘adainit’
     and ‘adafinal’ procedures (*note Binding with Non-Ada Main
     Programs: 7e.) are renamed to ‘XXXinit’ and ‘XXXfinal’.  Implies
     -n.  (*note GNAT and Libraries: 2a, for more details.)

‘-M`xyz'’

     Rename generated main program from main to xyz.  This option is
     supported on cross environments only.

‘-m`n'’

     Limit number of detected errors or warnings to ‘n’, where ‘n’ is in
     the range 1..999999.  The default value if no switch is given is
     9999.  If the number of warnings reaches this limit, then a message
     is output and further warnings are suppressed, the bind continues
     in this case.  If the number of errors reaches this limit, then a
     message is output and the bind is abandoned.  A value of zero means
     that no limit is enforced.  The equal sign is optional.

‘-minimal’

     Generate a binder file suitable for space-constrained applications.
     When active, binder-generated objects not required for program
     operation are no longer generated.  ‘Warning:’ this option comes
     with the following limitations:

        * Starting the program’s execution in the debugger will cause it
          to stop at the start of the ‘main’ function instead of the
          main subprogram.  This can be worked around by manually
          inserting a breakpoint on that subprogram and resuming the
          program’s execution until reaching that breakpoint.

        * Programs using GNAT.Compiler_Version will not link.

‘-n’

     No main program.

‘-nostdinc’

     Do not look for sources in the system default directory.

‘-nostdlib’

     Do not look for library files in the system default directory.

‘--RTS=`rts-path'’

     Specifies the default location of the run-time library.  Same
     meaning as the equivalent ‘gnatmake’ flag (*note Switches for
     gnatmake: d0.).

‘-o `file'’

     Name the output file ‘file’ (default is ‘b~`xxx’.adb‘).  Note that
     if this option is used, then linking must be done manually,
     gnatlink cannot be used.

‘-O[=`filename']’

     Output object list (to standard output or to the named file).

‘-p’

     Pessimistic (worst-case) elaboration order.

‘-P’

     Generate binder file suitable for CodePeer.

‘-Q`nnn'’

     Generate ‘nnn’ additional default-sized secondary stacks.

     Tasks declared at the library level that use default-size secondary
     stacks have their secondary stacks allocated from a pool of stacks
     generated by gnatbind.  This allows the default secondary stack
     size to be quickly changed by rebinding the application.

     While the binder sizes this pool to match the number of such tasks
     defined in the application, the pool size may need to be increased
     with the ‘-Q’ switch to accommodate foreign threads registered with
     the Light run-time.  For more information, please see the ‘The
     Primary and Secondary Stack’ chapter in the ‘GNAT User’s Guide
     Supplement for Cross Platforms’.

‘-R’

     Output closure source list, which includes all non-run-time units
     that are included in the bind.

‘-Ra’

     Like ‘-R’ but the list includes run-time units.

‘-s’

     Require all source files to be present.

‘-S`xxx'’

     Specifies the value to be used when detecting uninitialized scalar
     objects with pragma Initialize_Scalars.  The ‘xxx’ string specified
     with the switch is one of:

        * ‘in’ for an invalid value.

          If zero is invalid for the discrete type in question, then the
          scalar value is set to all zero bits.  For signed discrete
          types, the largest possible negative value of the underlying
          scalar is set (i.e.  a one bit followed by all zero bits).
          For unsigned discrete types, the underlying scalar value is
          set to all one bits.  For floating-point types, a NaN value is
          set (see body of package System.Scalar_Values for exact
          values).

        * ‘lo’ for low value.

          If zero is invalid for the discrete type in question, then the
          scalar value is set to all zero bits.  For signed discrete
          types, the largest possible negative value of the underlying
          scalar is set (i.e.  a one bit followed by all zero bits).
          For unsigned discrete types, the underlying scalar value is
          set to all zero bits.  For floating-point, a small value is
          set (see body of package System.Scalar_Values for exact
          values).

        * ‘hi’ for high value.

          If zero is invalid for the discrete type in question, then the
          scalar value is set to all one bits.  For signed discrete
          types, the largest possible positive value of the underlying
          scalar is set (i.e.  a zero bit followed by all one bits).
          For unsigned discrete types, the underlying scalar value is
          set to all one bits.  For floating-point, a large value is set
          (see body of package System.Scalar_Values for exact values).

        * ‘xx’ for hex value (two hex digits).

          The underlying scalar is set to a value consisting of repeated
          bytes, whose value corresponds to the given value.  For
          example if ‘BF’ is given, then a 32-bit scalar value will be
          set to the bit pattern ‘16#BFBFBFBF#’.

     In addition, you can specify ‘-Sev’ to indicate that the value is
     to be set at run time.  In this case, the program will look for an
     environment variable of the form ‘GNAT_INIT_SCALARS=YY’, where ‘yy’
     is one of ‘in/lo/hi/XX’ with the same meanings as above.  If no
     environment variable is found, or if it does not have a valid
     value, then the default is ‘in’ (invalid values).

‘-static’

     Link against a static GNAT run-time.

‘-shared’

     Link against a shared GNAT run-time when available.

‘-t’

     Tolerate time stamp and other consistency errors.

‘-T`n'’

     Set the time slice value to ‘n’ milliseconds.  If the system
     supports the specification of a specific time slice value, then the
     indicated value is used.  If the system does not support specific
     time slice values, but does support some general notion of
     round-robin scheduling, then any nonzero value will activate
     round-robin scheduling.

     A value of zero is treated specially.  It turns off time slicing,
     and in addition, indicates to the tasking run-time that the
     semantics should match as closely as possible the Annex D
     requirements of the Ada RM, and in particular sets the default
     scheduling policy to ‘FIFO_Within_Priorities’.

‘-u`n'’

     Enable dynamic stack usage, with ‘n’ results stored and displayed
     at program termination.  A result is generated when a task
     terminates.  Results that can’t be stored are displayed on the fly,
     at task termination.  This option is currently not supported on
     Itanium platforms.  (See *note Dynamic Stack Usage Analysis: 115.
     for details.)

‘-v’

     Verbose mode.  Write error messages, header, summary output to
     ‘stdout’.

‘-V`key'=`value'’

     Store the given association of ‘key’ to ‘value’ in the bind
     environment.  Values stored this way can be retrieved at run time
     using ‘GNAT.Bind_Environment’.

‘-w`x'’

     Warning mode; ‘x’ = s/e for suppress/treat as error.

‘-Wx`e'’

     Override default wide character encoding for standard Text_IO
     files.

‘-x’

     Exclude source files (check object consistency only).

‘-xdr’

     Use the target-independent XDR protocol for stream oriented
     attributes instead of the default implementation which is based on
     direct binary representations and is therefore target-and
     endianness-dependent.  However it does not support 128-bit integer
     types and the exception ‘Ada.IO_Exceptions.Device_Error’ is raised
     if any attempt is made at streaming 128-bit integer types with it.

‘-X`nnn'’

     Set default exit status value, normally 0 for POSIX compliance.

‘-y’

     Enable leap seconds support in ‘Ada.Calendar’ and its children.

‘-z’

     No main subprogram.

You may obtain this listing of switches by running ‘gnatbind’ with no
arguments.

4.5.2.1 Consistency-Checking Modes
..................................

As described earlier, by default ‘gnatbind’ checks that object files are
consistent with one another and are consistent with any source files it
can locate.  The following switches control binder access to sources.

‘-s’

     Require source files to be present.  In this mode, the binder must
     be able to locate all source files that are referenced, in order to
     check their consistency.  In normal mode, if a source file cannot
     be located it is simply ignored.  If you specify this switch, a
     missing source file is an error.

‘-Wx`e'’

     Override default wide character encoding for standard Text_IO
     files.  Normally the default wide character encoding method used
     for standard [Wide_[Wide_]]Text_IO files is taken from the encoding
     specified for the main source input (see description of switch
     ‘-gnatWx’ for the compiler).  The use of this switch for the binder
     (which has the same set of possible arguments) overrides this
     default as specified.

‘-x’

     Exclude source files.  In this mode, the binder only checks that
     ALI files are consistent with one another.  Source files are not
     accessed.  The binder runs faster in this mode, and there is still
     a guarantee that the resulting program is self-consistent.  If a
     source file has been edited since it was last compiled, and you
     specify this switch, the binder will not detect that the object
     file is out of date with respect to the source file.  Note that
     this is the mode that is automatically used by ‘gnatmake’ because
     in this case the checking against sources has already been
     performed by ‘gnatmake’ in the course of compilation (i.e., before
     binding).

4.5.2.2 Binder Error Message Control
....................................

The following switches provide control over the generation of error
messages from the binder:

‘-v’

     Verbose mode.  In the normal mode, brief error messages are
     generated to ‘stderr’.  If this switch is present, a header is
     written to ‘stdout’ and any error messages are directed to
     ‘stdout’.  All that is written to ‘stderr’ is a brief summary
     message.

‘-b’

     Generate brief error messages to ‘stderr’ even if verbose mode is
     specified.  This is relevant only when used with the ‘-v’ switch.

‘-m`n'’

     Limits the number of error messages to ‘n’, a decimal integer in
     the range 1-999.  The binder terminates immediately if this limit
     is reached.

‘-M`xxx'’

     Renames the generated main program from ‘main’ to ‘xxx’.  This is
     useful in the case of some cross-building environments, where the
     actual main program is separate from the one generated by
     ‘gnatbind’.

‘-ws’

     Suppress all warning messages.

‘-we’

     Treat any warning messages as fatal errors.

‘-t’

     The binder performs a number of consistency checks including:

        * Check that time stamps of a given source unit are consistent

        * Check that checksums of a given source unit are consistent

        * Check that consistent versions of ‘GNAT’ were used for
          compilation

        * Check consistency of configuration pragmas as required

     Normally failure of such checks, in accordance with the consistency
     requirements of the Ada Reference Manual, causes error messages to
     be generated which abort the binder and prevent the output of a
     binder file and subsequent link to obtain an executable.

     The ‘-t’ switch converts these error messages into warnings, so
     that binding and linking can continue to completion even in the
     presence of such errors.  The result may be a failed link (due to
     missing symbols), or a non-functional executable which has
     undefined semantics.

          Note: This means that ‘-t’ should be used only in unusual
          situations, with extreme care.

4.5.2.3 Elaboration Control
...........................

The following switches provide additional control over the elaboration
order.  For further details see *note Elaboration Order Handling in
GNAT: f.

‘-f`elab-order'’

     Force elaboration order.

     ‘elab-order’ should be the name of a “forced elaboration order
     file”, that is, a text file containing library item names, one per
     line.  A name of the form “some.unit%s” or “some.unit (spec)”
     denotes the spec of Some.Unit.  A name of the form “some.unit%b” or
     “some.unit (body)” denotes the body of Some.Unit.  Each pair of
     lines is taken to mean that there is an elaboration dependence of
     the second line on the first.  For example, if the file contains:

          this (spec)
          this (body)
          that (spec)
          that (body)

     then the spec of This will be elaborated before the body of This,
     and the body of This will be elaborated before the spec of That,
     and the spec of That will be elaborated before the body of That.
     The first and last of these three dependences are already required
     by Ada rules, so this file is really just forcing the body of This
     to be elaborated before the spec of That.

     The given order must be consistent with Ada rules, or else
     ‘gnatbind’ will give elaboration cycle errors.  For example, if you
     say x (body) should be elaborated before x (spec), there will be a
     cycle, because Ada rules require x (spec) to be elaborated before x
     (body); you can’t have the spec and body both elaborated before
     each other.

     If you later add “with That;” to the body of This, there will be a
     cycle, in which case you should erase either “this (body)” or “that
     (spec)” from the above forced elaboration order file.

     Blank lines and Ada-style comments are ignored.  Unit names that do
     not exist in the program are ignored.  Units in the GNAT predefined
     library are also ignored.

‘-p’

     Pessimistic elaboration order

     This switch is only applicable to the pre-20.x legacy elaboration
     models.  The post-20.x elaboration model uses a more informed
     approach of ordering the units.

     Normally the binder attempts to choose an elaboration order that is
     likely to minimize the likelihood of an elaboration order error
     resulting in raising a ‘Program_Error’ exception.  This switch
     reverses the action of the binder, and requests that it
     deliberately choose an order that is likely to maximize the
     likelihood of an elaboration error.  This is useful in ensuring
     portability and avoiding dependence on accidental fortuitous
     elaboration ordering.

     Normally it only makes sense to use the ‘-p’ switch if dynamic
     elaboration checking is used (‘-gnatE’ switch used for
     compilation).  This is because in the default static elaboration
     mode, all necessary ‘Elaborate’ and ‘Elaborate_All’ pragmas are
     implicitly inserted.  These implicit pragmas are still respected by
     the binder in ‘-p’ mode, so a safe elaboration order is assured.

     Note that ‘-p’ is not intended for production use; it is more for
     debugging/experimental use.

4.5.2.4 Output Control
......................

The following switches allow additional control over the output
generated by the binder.

‘-c’

     Check only.  Do not generate the binder output file.  In this mode
     the binder performs all error checks but does not generate an
     output file.

‘-e’

     Output complete list of elaboration-order dependencies, showing the
     reason for each dependency.  This output can be rather extensive
     but may be useful in diagnosing problems with elaboration order.
     The output is written to ‘stdout’.

‘-h’

     Output usage information.  The output is written to ‘stdout’.

‘-K’

     Output linker options to ‘stdout’.  Includes library search paths,
     contents of pragmas Ident and Linker_Options, and libraries added
     by ‘gnatbind’.

‘-l’

     Output chosen elaboration order.  The output is written to
     ‘stdout’.

‘-O’

     Output full names of all the object files that must be linked to
     provide the Ada component of the program.  The output is written to
     ‘stdout’.  This list includes the files explicitly supplied and
     referenced by the user as well as implicitly referenced run-time
     unit files.  The latter are omitted if the corresponding units
     reside in shared libraries.  The directory names for the run-time
     units depend on the system configuration.

‘-o `file'’

     Set name of output file to ‘file’ instead of the normal
     ‘b~`mainprog’.adb‘ default.  Note that ‘file’ denote the Ada binder
     generated body filename.  Note that if this option is used, then
     linking must be done manually.  It is not possible to use gnatlink
     in this case, since it cannot locate the binder file.

‘-r’

     Generate list of ‘pragma Restrictions’ that could be applied to the
     current unit.  This is useful for code audit purposes, and also may
     be used to improve code generation in some cases.

4.5.2.5 Dynamic Allocation Control
..................................

The heap control switches – ‘-H32’ and ‘-H64’ – determine whether
dynamic allocation uses 32-bit or 64-bit memory.  They only affect
compiler-generated allocations via ‘__gnat_malloc’; explicit calls to
‘malloc’ and related functions from the C run-time library are
unaffected.

‘-H32’

     Allocate memory on 32-bit heap

‘-H64’

     Allocate memory on 64-bit heap.  This is the default unless
     explicitly overridden by a ‘'Size’ clause on the access type.

These switches are only effective on VMS platforms.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Binding with Non-Ada Main Programs,  Next: Binding Programs with No Main Subprogram,  Prev: Dynamic Allocation Control,  Up: Switches for gnatbind

4.5.2.6 Binding with Non-Ada Main Programs
..........................................

The description so far has assumed that the main program is in Ada, and
that the task of the binder is to generate a corresponding function
‘main’ that invokes this Ada main program.  GNAT also supports the
building of executable programs where the main program is not in Ada,
but some of the called routines are written in Ada and compiled using
GNAT (*note Mixed Language Programming: 2c.).  The following switch is
used in this situation:

‘-n’

     No main program.  The main program is not in Ada.

In this case, most of the functions of the binder are still required,
but instead of generating a main program, the binder generates a file
containing the following callable routines:

     ‘adainit’

          You must call this routine to initialize the Ada part of the
          program by calling the necessary elaboration routines.  A call
          to ‘adainit’ is required before the first call to an Ada
          subprogram.

          Note that it is assumed that the basic execution environment
          must be setup to be appropriate for Ada execution at the point
          where the first Ada subprogram is called.  In particular, if
          the Ada code will do any floating-point operations, then the
          FPU must be setup in an appropriate manner.  For the case of
          the x86, for example, full precision mode is required.  The
          procedure GNAT.Float_Control.Reset may be used to ensure that
          the FPU is in the right state.

     ‘adafinal’

          You must call this routine to perform any library-level
          finalization required by the Ada subprograms.  A call to
          ‘adafinal’ is required after the last call to an Ada
          subprogram, and before the program terminates.

If the ‘-n’ switch is given, more than one ALI file may appear on the
command line for ‘gnatbind’.  The normal ‘closure’ calculation is
performed for each of the specified units.  Calculating the closure
means finding out the set of units involved by tracing ‘with’
references.  The reason it is necessary to be able to specify more than
one ALI file is that a given program may invoke two or more quite
separate groups of Ada units.

The binder takes the name of its output file from the last specified ALI
file, unless overridden by the use of the ‘-o file’.

The output is an Ada unit in source form that can be compiled with GNAT.
This compilation occurs automatically as part of the ‘gnatlink’
processing.

Currently the GNAT run-time requires a FPU using 80 bits mode precision.
Under targets where this is not the default it is required to call
GNAT.Float_Control.Reset before using floating point numbers (this
include float computation, float input and output) in the Ada code.  A
side effect is that this could be the wrong mode for the foreign code
where floating point computation could be broken after this call.

4.5.2.7 Binding Programs with No Main Subprogram
................................................

It is possible to have an Ada program which does not have a main
subprogram.  This program will call the elaboration routines of all the
packages, then the finalization routines.

The following switch is used to bind programs organized in this manner:

‘-z’

     Normally the binder checks that the unit name given on the command
     line corresponds to a suitable main subprogram.  When this switch
     is used, a list of ALI files can be given, and the execution of the
     program consists of elaboration of these units in an appropriate
     order.  Note that the default wide character encoding method for
     standard Text_IO files is always set to Brackets if this switch is
     set (you can use the binder switch ‘-Wx’ to override this default).


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Command-Line Access,  Next: Search Paths for gnatbind,  Prev: Switches for gnatbind,  Up: Binding with gnatbind

4.5.3 Command-Line Access
-------------------------

The package ‘Ada.Command_Line’ provides access to the command-line
arguments and program name.  In order for this interface to operate
correctly, the two variables

     int gnat_argc;
     char **gnat_argv;

are declared in one of the GNAT library routines.  These variables must
be set from the actual ‘argc’ and ‘argv’ values passed to the main
program.  With no ‘n’ present, ‘gnatbind’ generates the C main program
to automatically set these variables.  If the ‘n’ switch is used, there
is no automatic way to set these variables.  If they are not set, the
procedures in ‘Ada.Command_Line’ will not be available, and any attempt
to use them will raise ‘Constraint_Error’.  If command line access is
required, your main program must set ‘gnat_argc’ and ‘gnat_argv’ from
the ‘argc’ and ‘argv’ values passed to it.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Search Paths for gnatbind,  Next: Examples of gnatbind Usage,  Prev: Command-Line Access,  Up: Binding with gnatbind

4.5.4 Search Paths for ‘gnatbind’
---------------------------------

The binder takes the name of an ALI file as its argument and needs to
locate source files as well as other ALI files to verify object
consistency.

For source files, it follows exactly the same search rules as ‘gcc’ (see
*note Search Paths and the Run-Time Library (RTL): 73.).  For ALI files
the directories searched are:

   * The directory containing the ALI file named in the command line,
     unless the switch ‘-I-’ is specified.

   * All directories specified by ‘-I’ switches on the ‘gnatbind’
     command line, in the order given.

   * Each of the directories listed in the text file whose name is given
     by the ‘ADA_PRJ_OBJECTS_FILE’ environment variable.

     ‘ADA_PRJ_OBJECTS_FILE’ is normally set by gnatmake or by the gnat
     driver when project files are used.  It should not normally be set
     by other means.

   * Each of the directories listed in the value of the
     ‘ADA_OBJECTS_PATH’ environment variable.  Construct this value
     exactly as the ‘PATH’ environment variable: a list of directory
     names separated by colons (semicolons when working with the NT
     version of GNAT).

   * The content of the ‘ada_object_path’ file which is part of the GNAT
     installation tree and is used to store standard libraries such as
     the GNAT Run-Time Library (RTL) unless the switch ‘-nostdlib’ is
     specified.  See *note Installing a library: 72.

In the binder the switch ‘-I’ is used to specify both source and library
file paths.  Use ‘-aI’ instead if you want to specify source paths only,
and ‘-aO’ if you want to specify library paths only.  This means that
for the binder ‘-I`dir'’ is equivalent to ‘-aI`dir'’ ‘-aO``dir'’.  The
binder generates the bind file (a C language source file) in the current
working directory.

The packages ‘Ada’, ‘System’, and ‘Interfaces’ and their children make
up the GNAT Run-Time Library, together with the package GNAT and its
children, which contain a set of useful additional library functions
provided by GNAT. The sources for these units are needed by the compiler
and are kept together in one directory.  The ALI files and object files
generated by compiling the RTL are needed by the binder and the linker
and are kept together in one directory, typically different from the
directory containing the sources.  In a normal installation, you need
not specify these directory names when compiling or binding.  Either the
environment variables or the built-in defaults cause these files to be
found.

Besides simplifying access to the RTL, a major use of search paths is in
compiling sources from multiple directories.  This can make development
environments much more flexible.

4.5.5 Examples of ‘gnatbind’ Usage
----------------------------------

Here are some examples of ‘gnatbind’ invocations:

          gnatbind hello

     The main program ‘Hello’ (source program in ‘hello.adb’) is bound
     using the standard switch settings.  The generated main program is
     ‘b~hello.adb’.  This is the normal, default use of the binder.

          gnatbind hello -o mainprog.adb

     The main program ‘Hello’ (source program in ‘hello.adb’) is bound
     using the standard switch settings.  The generated main program is
     ‘mainprog.adb’ with the associated spec in ‘mainprog.ads’.  Note
     that you must specify the body here not the spec.  Note that if
     this option is used, then linking must be done manually, since
     gnatlink will not be able to find the generated file.

4.6 Linking with ‘gnatlink’
===========================

This chapter discusses ‘gnatlink’, a tool that links an Ada program and
builds an executable file.  This utility invokes the system linker (via
the ‘gcc’ command) with a correct list of object files and library
references.  ‘gnatlink’ automatically determines the list of files and
references for the Ada part of a program.  It uses the binder file
generated by the ‘gnatbind’ to determine this list.

* Switches for gnatlink::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Running gnatlink,  Next: Switches for gnatlink,  Up: Linking with gnatlink

4.6.1 Running ‘gnatlink’
------------------------

The form of the ‘gnatlink’ command is

     $ gnatlink [ switches ] mainprog [.ali]
                [ non-Ada objects ] [ linker options ]

The arguments of ‘gnatlink’ (switches, main ‘ALI’ file, non-Ada objects
or linker options) may be in any order, provided that no non-Ada object
may be mistaken for a main ‘ALI’ file.  Any file name ‘F’ without the
‘.ali’ extension will be taken as the main ‘ALI’ file if a file exists
whose name is the concatenation of ‘F’ and ‘.ali’.

‘mainprog.ali’ references the ALI file of the main program.  The ‘.ali’
extension of this file can be omitted.  From this reference, ‘gnatlink’
locates the corresponding binder file ‘b~mainprog.adb’ and, using the
information in this file along with the list of non-Ada objects and
linker options, constructs a linker command file to create the
executable.

The arguments other than the ‘gnatlink’ switches and the main ‘ALI’ file
are passed to the linker uninterpreted.  They typically include the
names of object files for units written in other languages than Ada and
any library references required to resolve references in any of these
foreign language units, or in ‘Import’ pragmas in any Ada units.

‘linker options’ is an optional list of linker specific switches.  The
default linker called by gnatlink is ‘gcc’ which in turn calls the
appropriate system linker.

One useful option for the linker is ‘-s’: it reduces the size of the
executable by removing all symbol table and relocation information from
the executable.

Standard options for the linker such as ‘-lmy_lib’ or ‘-Ldir’ can be
added as is.  For options that are not recognized by ‘gcc’ as linker
options, use the ‘gcc’ switches ‘-Xlinker’ or ‘-Wl,’.

Refer to the GCC documentation for details.

Here is an example showing how to generate a linker map:

     $ gnatlink my_prog -Wl,-Map,MAPFILE

Using ‘linker options’ it is possible to set the program stack and heap
size.  See *note Setting Stack Size from gnatlink: 129. and *note
Setting Heap Size from gnatlink: 12a.

‘gnatlink’ determines the list of objects required by the Ada program
and prepends them to the list of objects passed to the linker.
‘gnatlink’ also gathers any arguments set by the use of ‘pragma
Linker_Options’ and adds them to the list of arguments presented to the
linker.

4.6.2 Switches for ‘gnatlink’
-----------------------------

The following switches are available with the ‘gnatlink’ utility:

‘--version’

     Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

‘--help’

     If ‘--version’ was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
     all other options.

‘-f’

     On some targets, the command line length is limited, and ‘gnatlink’
     will generate a separate file for the linker if the list of object
     files is too long.  The ‘-f’ switch forces this file to be
     generated even if the limit is not exceeded.  This is useful in
     some cases to deal with special situations where the command line
     length is exceeded.

‘-g’

     The option to include debugging information causes the Ada bind
     file (in other words, ‘b~mainprog.adb’) to be compiled with ‘-g’.
     In addition, the binder does not delete the ‘b~mainprog.adb’,
     ‘b~mainprog.o’ and ‘b~mainprog.ali’ files.  Without ‘-g’, the
     binder removes these files by default.

‘-n’

     Do not compile the file generated by the binder.  This may be used
     when a link is rerun with different options, but there is no need
     to recompile the binder file.

‘-v’

     Verbose mode.  Causes additional information to be output,
     including a full list of the included object files.  This switch
     option is most useful when you want to see what set of object files
     are being used in the link step.

‘-v -v’

     Very verbose mode.  Requests that the compiler operate in verbose
     mode when it compiles the binder file, and that the system linker
     run in verbose mode.

‘-o `exec-name'’

     ‘exec-name’ specifies an alternate name for the generated
     executable program.  If this switch is omitted, the executable has
     the same name as the main unit.  For example, ‘gnatlink try.ali’
     creates an executable called ‘try’.

‘-B`dir'’

     Load compiler executables (for example, ‘gnat1’, the Ada compiler)
     from ‘dir’ instead of the default location.  Only use this switch
     when multiple versions of the GNAT compiler are available.  See the
     ‘Directory Options’ section in ‘The_GNU_Compiler_Collection’ for
     further details.  You would normally use the ‘-b’ or ‘-V’ switch
     instead.

‘-M’

     When linking an executable, create a map file.  The name of the map
     file has the same name as the executable with extension “.map”.

‘-M=`mapfile'’

     When linking an executable, create a map file.  The name of the map
     file is ‘mapfile’.

‘--GCC=`compiler_name'’

     Program used for compiling the binder file.  The default is ‘gcc’.
     You need to use quotes around ‘compiler_name’ if ‘compiler_name’
     contains spaces or other separator characters.  As an example
     ‘--GCC="foo -x -y"’ will instruct ‘gnatlink’ to use ‘foo -x -y’ as
     your compiler.  Note that switch ‘-c’ is always inserted after your
     command name.  Thus in the above example the compiler command that
     will be used by ‘gnatlink’ will be ‘foo -c -x -y’.  A limitation of
     this syntax is that the name and path name of the executable itself
     must not include any embedded spaces.  If the compiler executable
     is different from the default one (gcc or <prefix>-gcc), then the
     back-end switches in the ALI file are not used to compile the
     binder generated source.  For example, this is the case with
     ‘--GCC="foo -x -y"’.  But the back end switches will be used for
     ‘--GCC="gcc -gnatv"’.  If several ‘--GCC=compiler_name’ are used,
     only the last ‘compiler_name’ is taken into account.  However, all
     the additional switches are also taken into account.  Thus,
     ‘--GCC="foo -x -y" --GCC="bar -z -t"’ is equivalent to ‘--GCC="bar
     -x -y -z -t"’.

‘--LINK=`name'’

     ‘name’ is the name of the linker to be invoked.  This is especially
     useful in mixed language programs since languages such as C++
     require their own linker to be used.  When this switch is omitted,
     the default name for the linker is ‘gcc’.  When this switch is
     used, the specified linker is called instead of ‘gcc’ with exactly
     the same parameters that would have been passed to ‘gcc’ so if the
     desired linker requires different parameters it is necessary to use
     a wrapper script that massages the parameters before invoking the
     real linker.  It may be useful to control the exact invocation by
     using the verbose switch.

4.7 Using the GNU ‘make’ Utility
================================

This chapter offers some examples of makefiles that solve specific
problems.  It does not explain how to write a makefile, nor does it try
to replace the ‘gnatmake’ utility (*note Building with gnatmake: c8.).

All the examples in this section are specific to the GNU version of
make.  Although ‘make’ is a standard utility, and the basic language is
the same, these examples use some advanced features found only in ‘GNU
make’.

4.7.1 Using gnatmake in a Makefile
----------------------------------

Complex project organizations can be handled in a very powerful way by
using GNU make combined with gnatmake.  For instance, here is a Makefile
which allows you to build each subsystem of a big project into a
separate shared library.  Such a makefile allows you to significantly
reduce the link time of very big applications while maintaining full
coherence at each step of the build process.

The list of dependencies are handled automatically by ‘gnatmake’.  The
Makefile is simply used to call gnatmake in each of the appropriate
directories.

Note that you should also read the example on how to automatically
create the list of directories (*note Automatically Creating a List of
Directories: 130.) which might help you in case your project has a lot
of subdirectories.

     ## This Makefile is intended to be used with the following directory
     ## configuration:
     ##  - The sources are split into a series of csc (computer software components)
     ##    Each of these csc is put in its own directory.
     ##    Their name are referenced by the directory names.
     ##    They will be compiled into shared library (although this would also work
     ##    with static libraries)
     ##  - The main program (and possibly other packages that do not belong to any
     ##    csc) is put in the top level directory (where the Makefile is).
     ##       toplevel_dir __ first_csc  (sources) __ lib (will contain the library)
     ##                    \\_ second_csc (sources) __ lib (will contain the library)
     ##                    \\_ ...
     ## Although this Makefile is build for shared library, it is easy to modify
     ## to build partial link objects instead (modify the lines with -shared and
     ## gnatlink below)
     ##
     ## With this makefile, you can change any file in the system or add any new
     ## file, and everything will be recompiled correctly (only the relevant shared
     ## objects will be recompiled, and the main program will be re-linked).

     # The list of computer software component for your project. This might be
     # generated automatically.
     CSC_LIST=aa bb cc

     # Name of the main program (no extension)
     MAIN=main

     # If we need to build objects with -fPIC, uncomment the following line
     #NEED_FPIC=-fPIC

     # The following variable should give the directory containing libgnat.so
     # You can get this directory through 'gnatls -v'. This is usually the last
     # directory in the Object_Path.
     GLIB=...

     # The directories for the libraries
     # (This macro expands the list of CSC to the list of shared libraries, you
     # could simply use the expanded form:
     # LIB_DIR=aa/lib/libaa.so bb/lib/libbb.so cc/lib/libcc.so
     LIB_DIR=${foreach dir,${CSC_LIST},${dir}/lib/lib${dir}.so}

4.7.2 Automatically Creating a List of Directories
--------------------------------------------------

In most makefiles, you will have to specify a list of directories, and
store it in a variable.  For small projects, it is often easier to
specify each of them by hand, since you then have full control over what
is the proper order for these directories, which ones should be
included.

However, in larger projects, which might involve hundreds of
subdirectories, it might be more convenient to generate this list
automatically.

The example below presents two methods.  The first one, although less
general, gives you more control over the list.  It involves wildcard
characters, that are automatically expanded by ‘make’.  Its shortcoming
is that you need to explicitly specify some of the organization of your
project, such as for instance the directory tree depth, whether some
directories are found in a separate tree, etc.

The second method is the most general one.  It requires an external
program, called ‘find’, which is standard on all Unix systems.  All the
directories found under a given root directory will be added to the
list.

     # The examples below are based on the following directory hierarchy:
     # All the directories can contain any number of files
     # ROOT_DIRECTORY ->  a  ->  aa  ->  aaa
     #                       ->  ab
     #                       ->  ac
     #                ->  b  ->  ba  ->  baa
     #                       ->  bb
     #                       ->  bc
     # This Makefile creates a variable called DIRS, that can be reused any time
     # you need this list (see the other examples in this section)

     # The root of your project's directory hierarchy
     ROOT_DIRECTORY=.

     ####
     # First method: specify explicitly the list of directories
     # This allows you to specify any subset of all the directories you need.
     ####

     DIRS := a/aa/ a/ab/ b/ba/

     ####
     # Second method: use wildcards
     # Note that the argument(s) to wildcard below should end with a '/'.
     # Since wildcards also return file names, we have to filter them out
     # to avoid duplicate directory names.
     # We thus use make's ``dir`` and ``sort`` functions.
     # It sets DIRs to the following value (note that the directories aaa and baa
     # are not given, unless you change the arguments to wildcard).
     # DIRS= ./a/a/ ./b/ ./a/aa/ ./a/ab/ ./a/ac/ ./b/ba/ ./b/bb/ ./b/bc/
     ####

     DIRS := ${sort ${dir ${wildcard ${ROOT_DIRECTORY}/*/
                         ${ROOT_DIRECTORY}/*/*/}}}

     ####
     # Third method: use an external program
     # This command is much faster if run on local disks, avoiding NFS slowdowns.
     # This is the most complete command: it sets DIRs to the following value:
     # DIRS= ./a ./a/aa ./a/aa/aaa ./a/ab ./a/ac ./b ./b/ba ./b/ba/baa ./b/bb ./b/bc
     ####

     DIRS := ${shell find ${ROOT_DIRECTORY} -type d -print}

4.7.3 Generating the Command Line Switches
------------------------------------------

Once you have created the list of directories as explained in the
previous section (*note Automatically Creating a List of Directories:
130.), you can easily generate the command line arguments to pass to
gnatmake.

For the sake of completeness, this example assumes that the source path
is not the same as the object path, and that you have two separate lists
of directories.

     # see "Automatically creating a list of directories" to create
     # these variables
     SOURCE_DIRS=
     OBJECT_DIRS=

     GNATMAKE_SWITCHES := ${patsubst %,-aI%,${SOURCE_DIRS}}
     GNATMAKE_SWITCHES += ${patsubst %,-aO%,${OBJECT_DIRS}}

     all:
             gnatmake ${GNATMAKE_SWITCHES} main_unit


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Overcoming Command Line Length Limits,  Prev: Generating the Command Line Switches,  Up: Using the GNU make Utility

4.7.4 Overcoming Command Line Length Limits
-------------------------------------------

One problem that might be encountered on big projects is that many
operating systems limit the length of the command line.  It is thus hard
to give gnatmake the list of source and object directories.

This example shows how you can set up environment variables, which will
make ‘gnatmake’ behave exactly as if the directories had been specified
on the command line, but have a much higher length limit (or even none
on most systems).

It assumes that you have created a list of directories in your Makefile,
using one of the methods presented in *note Automatically Creating a
List of Directories: 130.  For the sake of completeness, we assume that
the object path (where the ALI files are found) is different from the
sources patch.

Note a small trick in the Makefile below: for efficiency reasons, we
create two temporary variables (SOURCE_LIST and OBJECT_LIST), that are
expanded immediately by ‘make’.  This way we overcome the standard make
behavior which is to expand the variables only when they are actually
used.

On Windows, if you are using the standard Windows command shell, you
must replace colons with semicolons in the assignments to these
variables.

     # In this example, we create both ADA_INCLUDE_PATH and ADA_OBJECTS_PATH.
     # This is the same thing as putting the -I arguments on the command line.
     # (the equivalent of using -aI on the command line would be to define
     #  only ADA_INCLUDE_PATH, the equivalent of -aO is ADA_OBJECTS_PATH).
     # You can of course have different values for these variables.
     #
     # Note also that we need to keep the previous values of these variables, since
     # they might have been set before running 'make' to specify where the GNAT
     # library is installed.

     # see "Automatically creating a list of directories" to create these
     # variables
     SOURCE_DIRS=
     OBJECT_DIRS=

     empty:=
     space:=${empty} ${empty}
     SOURCE_LIST := ${subst ${space},:,${SOURCE_DIRS}}
     OBJECT_LIST := ${subst ${space},:,${OBJECT_DIRS}}
     ADA_INCLUDE_PATH += ${SOURCE_LIST}
     ADA_OBJECTS_PATH += ${OBJECT_LIST}
     export ADA_INCLUDE_PATH
     export ADA_OBJECTS_PATH

     all:
             gnatmake main_unit

5.1 The File Cleanup Utility ‘gnatclean’
========================================

‘gnatclean’ is a tool that allows the deletion of files produced by the
compiler, binder and linker, including ALI files, object files, tree
files, expanded source files, library files, interface copy source
files, binder generated files and executable files.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Running gnatclean,  Next: Switches for gnatclean,  Up: The File Cleanup Utility gnatclean

5.1.1 Running ‘gnatclean’
-------------------------

The ‘gnatclean’ command has the form:

          $ gnatclean switches names

where ‘names’ is a list of source file names.  Suffixes ‘.ads’ and ‘adb’
may be omitted.  If a project file is specified using switch ‘-P’, then
‘names’ may be completely omitted.

In normal mode, ‘gnatclean’ delete the files produced by the compiler
and, if switch ‘-c’ is not specified, by the binder and the linker.  In
informative-only mode, specified by switch ‘-n’, the list of files that
would have been deleted in normal mode is listed, but no file is
actually deleted.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Switches for gnatclean,  Prev: Running gnatclean,  Up: The File Cleanup Utility gnatclean

5.1.2 Switches for ‘gnatclean’
------------------------------

‘gnatclean’ recognizes the following switches:

‘--version’

     Display copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

‘--help’

     If ‘--version’ was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
     all other options.

‘--subdirs=`subdir'’

     Actual object directory of each project file is the subdirectory
     subdir of the object directory specified or defaulted in the
     project file.

‘--unchecked-shared-lib-imports’

     By default, shared library projects are not allowed to import
     static library projects.  When this switch is used on the command
     line, this restriction is relaxed.

‘-c’

     Only attempt to delete the files produced by the compiler, not
     those produced by the binder or the linker.  The files that are not
     to be deleted are library files, interface copy files, binder
     generated files and executable files.

‘-D `dir'’

     Indicate that ALI and object files should normally be found in
     directory ‘dir’.

‘-F’

     When using project files, if some errors or warnings are detected
     during parsing and verbose mode is not in effect (no use of switch
     -v), then error lines start with the full path name of the project
     file, rather than its simple file name.

‘-h’

     Output a message explaining the usage of ‘gnatclean’.

‘-n’

     Informative-only mode.  Do not delete any files.  Output the list
     of the files that would have been deleted if this switch was not
     specified.

‘-P`project'’

     Use project file ‘project’.  Only one such switch can be used.
     When cleaning a project file, the files produced by the compilation
     of the immediate sources or inherited sources of the project files
     are to be deleted.  This is not depending on the presence or not of
     executable names on the command line.

‘-q’

     Quiet output.  If there are no errors, do not output anything,
     except in verbose mode (switch -v) or in informative-only mode
     (switch -n).

‘-r’

     When a project file is specified (using switch -P), clean all
     imported and extended project files, recursively.  If this switch
     is not specified, only the files related to the main project file
     are to be deleted.  This switch has no effect if no project file is
     specified.

‘-v’

     Verbose mode.

‘-vP`x'’

     Indicates the verbosity of the parsing of GNAT project files.
     *note Switches Related to Project Files: d1.

‘-X`name'=`value'’

     Indicates that external variable ‘name’ has the value ‘value’.  The
     Project Manager will use this value for occurrences of
     ‘external(name)’ when parsing the project file.  See *note Switches
     Related to Project Files: d1.

‘-aO`dir'’

     When searching for ALI and object files, look in directory ‘dir’.

‘-I`dir'’

     Equivalent to ‘-aO`dir'’.

‘-I-’

     Do not look for ALI or object files in the directory where
     ‘gnatclean’ was invoked.

5.2 The GNAT Library Browser ‘gnatls’
=====================================

‘gnatls’ is a tool that outputs information about compiled units.  It
gives the relationship between objects, unit names and source files.  It
can also be used to check the source dependencies of a unit as well as
various characteristics.

5.2.1 Running ‘gnatls’
----------------------

The ‘gnatls’ command has the form

          $ gnatls switches object_or_ali_file

The main argument is the list of object or ‘ali’ files (see *note The
Ada Library Information Files: 28.) for which information is requested.

In normal mode, without additional option, ‘gnatls’ produces a
four-column listing.  Each line represents information for a specific
object.  The first column gives the full path of the object, the second
column gives the name of the principal unit in this object, the third
column gives the status of the source and the fourth column gives the
full path of the source representing this unit.  Here is a simple
example of use:

          $ gnatls *.o
          ./demo1.o            demo1            DIF demo1.adb
          ./demo2.o            demo2             OK demo2.adb
          ./hello.o            h1                OK hello.adb
          ./instr-child.o      instr.child      MOK instr-child.adb
          ./instr.o            instr             OK instr.adb
          ./tef.o              tef              DIF tef.adb
          ./text_io_example.o  text_io_example   OK text_io_example.adb
          ./tgef.o             tgef             DIF tgef.adb

The first line can be interpreted as follows: the main unit which is
contained in object file ‘demo1.o’ is demo1, whose main source is in
‘demo1.adb’.  Furthermore, the version of the source used for the
compilation of demo1 has been modified (DIF). Each source file has a
status qualifier which can be:

‘OK (unchanged)’

     The version of the source file used for the compilation of the
     specified unit corresponds exactly to the actual source file.

‘MOK (slightly modified)’

     The version of the source file used for the compilation of the
     specified unit differs from the actual source file but not enough
     to require recompilation.  If you use gnatmake with the option ‘-m’
     (minimal recompilation), a file marked MOK will not be recompiled.

‘DIF (modified)’

     No version of the source found on the path corresponds to the
     source used to build this object.

‘??? (file not found)’

     No source file was found for this unit.

‘HID (hidden, unchanged version not first on PATH)’

     The version of the source that corresponds exactly to the source
     used for compilation has been found on the path but it is hidden by
     another version of the same source that has been modified.

‘gnatls’ recognizes the following switches:

‘--version’

     Display copyright and version, then exit disregarding all other
     options.

‘--help’

     If ‘--version’ was not used, display usage, then exit disregarding
     all other options.

‘-a’

     Consider all units, including those of the predefined Ada library.
     Especially useful with ‘-d’.

‘-d’

     List sources from which specified units depend on.

‘-h’

     Output the list of options.

‘-o’

     Only output information about object files.

‘-s’

     Only output information about source files.

‘-u’

     Only output information about compilation units.

‘-files=`file'’

     Take as arguments the files listed in text file ‘file’.  Text file
     ‘file’ may contain empty lines that are ignored.  Each nonempty
     line should contain the name of an existing file.  Several such
     switches may be specified simultaneously.

‘-aO`dir'’, ‘-aI`dir'’, ‘-I`dir'’, ‘-I-’, ‘-nostdinc’

     Source path manipulation.  Same meaning as the equivalent
     ‘gnatmake’ flags (*note Switches for gnatmake: d0.).

‘-aP`dir'’

     Add ‘dir’ at the beginning of the project search dir.

‘--RTS=`rts-path'’

     Specifies the default location of the runtime library.  Same
     meaning as the equivalent ‘gnatmake’ flag (*note Switches for
     gnatmake: d0.).

‘-v’

     Verbose mode.  Output the complete source, object and project
     paths.  Do not use the default column layout but instead use long
     format giving as much as information possible on each requested
     units, including special characteristics such as:

        * ‘Preelaborable’: The unit is preelaborable in the Ada sense.

        * ‘No_Elab_Code’: No elaboration code has been produced by the
          compiler for this unit.

        * ‘Pure’: The unit is pure in the Ada sense.

        * ‘Elaborate_Body’: The unit contains a pragma Elaborate_Body.

        * ‘Remote_Types’: The unit contains a pragma Remote_Types.

        * ‘Shared_Passive’: The unit contains a pragma Shared_Passive.

        * ‘Predefined’: This unit is part of the predefined environment
          and cannot be modified by the user.

        * ‘Remote_Call_Interface’: The unit contains a pragma
          Remote_Call_Interface.

               Source => demo1.adb    modified

The following is an example of use of the dependency list.  Note the use
of the -s switch which gives a straight list of source files.  This can
be useful for building specialized scripts.

          $ gnatls -d demo2.o
          ./demo2.o   demo2        OK demo2.adb

6.1 Running and Debugging Ada Programs
======================================

This section discusses how to debug Ada programs.

An incorrect Ada program may be handled in three ways by the GNAT
compiler:

   * The illegality may be a violation of the static semantics of Ada.
     In that case GNAT diagnoses the constructs in the program that are
     illegal.  It is then a straightforward matter for the user to
     modify those parts of the program.

   * The illegality may be a violation of the dynamic semantics of Ada.
     In that case the program compiles and executes, but may generate
     incorrect results, or may terminate abnormally with some exception.

   * When presented with a program that contains convoluted errors, GNAT
     itself may terminate abnormally without providing full diagnostics
     on the incorrect user program.

6.1.1 The GNAT Debugger GDB
---------------------------

‘GDB’ is a general purpose, platform-independent debugger that can be
used to debug mixed-language programs compiled with ‘gcc’, and in
particular is capable of debugging Ada programs compiled with GNAT. The
latest versions of ‘GDB’ are Ada-aware and can handle complex Ada data
structures.

See ‘Debugging with GDB’, for full details on the usage of ‘GDB’,
including a section on its usage on programs.  This manual should be
consulted for full details.  The section that follows is a brief
introduction to the philosophy and use of ‘GDB’.

When GNAT programs are compiled, the compiler optionally writes
debugging information into the generated object file, including
information on line numbers, and on declared types and variables.  This
information is separate from the generated code.  It makes the object
files considerably larger, but it does not add to the size of the actual
executable that will be loaded into memory, and has no impact on
run-time performance.  The generation of debug information is triggered
by the use of the ‘-g’ switch in the ‘gcc’ or ‘gnatmake’ command used to
carry out the compilations.  It is important to emphasize that the use
of these options does not change the generated code.

The debugging information is written in standard system formats that are
used by many tools, including debuggers and profilers.  The format of
the information is typically designed to describe C types and semantics,
but GNAT implements a translation scheme which allows full details about
Ada types and variables to be encoded into these standard C formats.
Details of this encoding scheme may be found in the file exp_dbug.ads in
the GNAT source distribution.  However, the details of this encoding
are, in general, of no interest to a user, since ‘GDB’ automatically
performs the necessary decoding.

When a program is bound and linked, the debugging information is
collected from the object files, and stored in the executable image of
the program.  Again, this process significantly increases the size of
the generated executable file, but it does not increase the size of the
executable program itself.  Furthermore, if this program is run in the
normal manner, it runs exactly as if the debug information were not
present, and takes no more actual memory.

However, if the program is run under control of ‘GDB’, the debugger is
activated.  The image of the program is loaded, at which point it is
ready to run.  If a run command is given, then the program will run
exactly as it would have if ‘GDB’ were not present.  This is a crucial
part of the ‘GDB’ design philosophy.  ‘GDB’ is entirely non-intrusive
until a breakpoint is encountered.  If no breakpoint is ever hit, the
program will run exactly as it would if no debugger were present.  When
a breakpoint is hit, ‘GDB’ accesses the debugging information and can
respond to user commands to inspect variables, and more generally to
report on the state of execution.

6.1.2 Running GDB
-----------------

This section describes how to initiate the debugger.

The debugger can be launched from a ‘GNAT Studio’ menu or directly from
the command line.  The description below covers the latter use.  All the
commands shown can be used in the ‘GNAT Studio’ debug console window,
but there are usually more GUI-based ways to achieve the same effect.

The command to run ‘GDB’ is

          $ gdb program

where ‘program’ is the name of the executable file.  This activates the
debugger and results in a prompt for debugger commands.  The simplest
command is simply ‘run’, which causes the program to run exactly as if
the debugger were not present.  The following section describes some of
the additional commands that can be given to ‘GDB’.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Introduction to GDB Commands,  Next: Using Ada Expressions,  Prev: Running GDB,  Up: Running and Debugging Ada Programs

6.1.3 Introduction to GDB Commands
----------------------------------

‘GDB’ contains a large repertoire of commands.  See ‘Debugging with GDB’
for extensive documentation on the use of these commands, together with
examples of their use.  Furthermore, the command ‘help’ invoked from
within GDB activates a simple help facility which summarizes the
available commands and their options.  In this section we summarize a
few of the most commonly used commands to give an idea of what ‘GDB’ is
about.  You should create a simple program with debugging information
and experiment with the use of these ‘GDB’ commands on the program as
you read through the following section.

   * 
     ‘set args ARGUMENTS’

          The ‘arguments’ list above is a list of arguments to be passed
          to the program on a subsequent run command, just as though the
          arguments had been entered on a normal invocation of the
          program.  The ‘set args’ command is not needed if the program
          does not require arguments.

   * 
     ‘run’

          The ‘run’ command causes execution of the program to start
          from the beginning.  If the program is already running, that
          is to say if you are currently positioned at a breakpoint,
          then a prompt will ask for confirmation that you want to
          abandon the current execution and restart.

   * 
     ‘breakpoint LOCATION’

          The breakpoint command sets a breakpoint, that is to say a
          point at which execution will halt and ‘GDB’ will await
          further commands.  ‘location’ is either a line number within a
          file, given in the format ‘file:linenumber’, or it is the name
          of a subprogram.  If you request that a breakpoint be set on a
          subprogram that is overloaded, a prompt will ask you to
          specify on which of those subprograms you want to breakpoint.
          You can also specify that all of them should be breakpointed.
          If the program is run and execution encounters the breakpoint,
          then the program stops and ‘GDB’ signals that the breakpoint
          was encountered by printing the line of code before which the
          program is halted.

   * 
     ‘catch exception NAME’

          This command causes the program execution to stop whenever
          exception ‘name’ is raised.  If ‘name’ is omitted, then the
          execution is suspended when any exception is raised.

   * 
     ‘print EXPRESSION’

          This will print the value of the given expression.  Most
          simple Ada expression formats are properly handled by ‘GDB’,
          so the expression can contain function calls, variables,
          operators, and attribute references.

   * 
     ‘continue’

          Continues execution following a breakpoint, until the next
          breakpoint or the termination of the program.

   * 
     ‘step’

          Executes a single line after a breakpoint.  If the next
          statement is a subprogram call, execution continues into (the
          first statement of) the called subprogram.

   * 
     ‘next’

          Executes a single line.  If this line is a subprogram call,
          executes and returns from the call.

   * 
     ‘list’

          Lists a few lines around the current source location.  In
          practice, it is usually more convenient to have a separate
          edit window open with the relevant source file displayed.
          Successive applications of this command print subsequent
          lines.  The command can be given an argument which is a line
          number, in which case it displays a few lines around the
          specified one.

   * 
     ‘backtrace’

          Displays a backtrace of the call chain.  This command is
          typically used after a breakpoint has occurred, to examine the
          sequence of calls that leads to the current breakpoint.  The
          display includes one line for each activation record (frame)
          corresponding to an active subprogram.

   * 
     ‘up’

          At a breakpoint, ‘GDB’ can display the values of variables
          local to the current frame.  The command ‘up’ can be used to
          examine the contents of other active frames, by moving the
          focus up the stack, that is to say from callee to caller, one
          frame at a time.

   * 
     ‘down’

          Moves the focus of ‘GDB’ down from the frame currently being
          examined to the frame of its callee (the reverse of the
          previous command),

   * 
     ‘frame N’

          Inspect the frame with the given number.  The value 0 denotes
          the frame of the current breakpoint, that is to say the top of
          the call stack.

   * 
     ‘kill’

          Kills the child process in which the program is running under
          GDB. This may be useful for several purposes:

             * It allows you to recompile and relink your program, since
               on many systems you cannot regenerate an executable file
               while it is running in a process.

             * You can run your program outside the debugger, on systems
               that do not permit executing a program outside GDB while
               breakpoints are set within GDB.

             * It allows you to debug a core dump rather than a running
               process.

The above list is a very short introduction to the commands that ‘GDB’
provides.  Important additional capabilities, including conditional
breakpoints, the ability to execute command sequences on a breakpoint,
the ability to debug at the machine instruction level and many other
features are described in detail in ‘Debugging with GDB’. Note that most
commands can be abbreviated (for example, c for continue, bt for
backtrace).

6.1.4 Using Ada Expressions
---------------------------

‘GDB’ supports a fairly large subset of Ada expression syntax, with some
extensions.  The philosophy behind the design of this subset is

        * That ‘GDB’ should provide basic literals and access to
          operations for arithmetic, dereferencing, field selection,
          indexing, and subprogram calls, leaving more sophisticated
          computations to subprograms written into the program (which
          therefore may be called from ‘GDB’).

        * That type safety and strict adherence to Ada language
          restrictions are not particularly relevant in a debugging
          context.

        * That brevity is important to the ‘GDB’ user.

Thus, for brevity, the debugger acts as if there were implicit ‘with’
and ‘use’ clauses in effect for all user-written packages, thus making
it unnecessary to fully qualify most names with their packages,
regardless of context.  Where this causes ambiguity, ‘GDB’ asks the
user’s intent.

For details on the supported Ada syntax, see ‘Debugging with GDB’.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Calling User-Defined Subprograms,  Next: Using the next Command in a Function,  Prev: Using Ada Expressions,  Up: Running and Debugging Ada Programs

6.1.5 Calling User-Defined Subprograms
--------------------------------------

An important capability of ‘GDB’ is the ability to call user-defined
subprograms while debugging.  This is achieved simply by entering a
subprogram call statement in the form:

          call subprogram-name (parameters)

The keyword ‘call’ can be omitted in the normal case where the
‘subprogram-name’ does not coincide with any of the predefined ‘GDB’
commands.

The effect is to invoke the given subprogram, passing it the list of
parameters that is supplied.  The parameters can be expressions and can
include variables from the program being debugged.  The subprogram must
be defined at the library level within your program, and ‘GDB’ will call
the subprogram within the environment of your program execution (which
means that the subprogram is free to access or even modify variables
within your program).

The most important use of this facility is in allowing the inclusion of
debugging routines that are tailored to particular data structures in
your program.  Such debugging routines can be written to provide a
suitably high-level description of an abstract type, rather than a
low-level dump of its physical layout.  After all, the standard ‘GDB
print’ command only knows the physical layout of your types, not their
abstract meaning.  Debugging routines can provide information at the
desired semantic level and are thus enormously useful.

For example, when debugging GNAT itself, it is crucial to have access to
the contents of the tree nodes used to represent the program internally.
But tree nodes are represented simply by an integer value (which in turn
is an index into a table of nodes).  Using the ‘print’ command on a tree
node would simply print this integer value, which is not very useful.
But the PN routine (defined in file treepr.adb in the GNAT sources)
takes a tree node as input, and displays a useful high level
representation of the tree node, which includes the syntactic category
of the node, its position in the source, the integers that denote
descendant nodes and parent node, as well as varied semantic
information.  To study this example in more detail, you might want to
look at the body of the PN procedure in the stated file.

Another useful application of this capability is to deal with situations
of complex data which are not handled suitably by GDB. For example, if
you specify Convention Fortran for a multi-dimensional array, GDB does
not know that the ordering of array elements has been switched and will
not properly address the array elements.  In such a case, instead of
trying to print the elements directly from GDB, you can write a callable
procedure that prints the elements in the desired format.

6.1.6 Using the ‘next’ Command in a Function
--------------------------------------------

When you use the ‘next’ command in a function, the current source
location will advance to the next statement as usual.  A special case
arises in the case of a ‘return’ statement.

Part of the code for a return statement is the ‘epilogue’ of the
function.  This is the code that returns to the caller.  There is only
one copy of this epilogue code, and it is typically associated with the
last return statement in the function if there is more than one return.
In some implementations, this epilogue is associated with the first
statement of the function.

The result is that if you use the ‘next’ command from a return statement
that is not the last return statement of the function you may see a
strange apparent jump to the last return statement or to the start of
the function.  You should simply ignore this odd jump.  The value
returned is always that from the first return statement that was stepped
through.

6.1.7 Stopping When Ada Exceptions Are Raised
---------------------------------------------

You can set catchpoints that stop the program execution when your
program raises selected exceptions.

   * 
     ‘catch exception’

          Set a catchpoint that stops execution whenever (any task in
          the) program raises any exception.

   * 
     ‘catch exception NAME’

          Set a catchpoint that stops execution whenever (any task in
          the) program raises the exception ‘name’.

   * 
     ‘catch exception unhandled’

          Set a catchpoint that stops executing whenever (any task in
          the) program raises an exception for which there is no
          handler.

   * 
     ‘info exceptions’, ‘info exceptions REGEXP’

          The ‘info exceptions’ command permits the user to examine all
          defined exceptions within Ada programs.  With a regular
          expression, ‘regexp’, as argument, prints out only those
          exceptions whose name matches ‘regexp’.

6.1.8 Ada Tasks
---------------

‘GDB’ allows the following task-related commands:

   * 
     ‘info tasks’

          This command shows a list of current Ada tasks, as in the
          following example:

               (gdb) info tasks
                 ID       TID P-ID   Thread Pri State                 Name
                  1   8088000   0   807e000  15 Child Activation Wait main_task
                  2   80a4000   1   80ae000  15 Accept/Select Wait    b
                  3   809a800   1   80a4800  15 Child Activation Wait a
               *  4   80ae800   3   80b8000  15 Running               c

          In this listing, the asterisk before the first task indicates
          it to be the currently running task.  The first column lists
          the task ID that is used to refer to tasks in the following
          commands.

   * ‘break’ ‘linespec’ ‘task’ ‘taskid’, ‘break’ ‘linespec’ ‘task’
     ‘taskid’ ‘if’ …

          These commands are like the ‘break ... thread ...’.
          ‘linespec’ specifies source lines.

          Use the qualifier ‘task TASKID’ with a breakpoint command to
          specify that you only want ‘GDB’ to stop the program when a
          particular Ada task reaches this breakpoint.  ‘taskid’ is one
          of the numeric task identifiers assigned by ‘GDB’, shown in
          the first column of the ‘info tasks’ display.

          If you do not specify ‘task TASKID’ when you set a breakpoint,
          the breakpoint applies to ‘all’ tasks of your program.

          You can use the ‘task’ qualifier on conditional breakpoints as
          well; in this case, place ‘task TASKID’ before the breakpoint
          condition (before the ‘if’).

   * ‘task TASKNO’

          This command allows switching to the task referred by
          ‘taskno’.  In particular, this allows browsing of the
          backtrace of the specified task.  It is advisable to switch
          back to the original task before continuing execution
          otherwise the scheduling of the program may be perturbed.

For more detailed information on the tasking support, see ‘Debugging
with GDB’.

6.1.9 Debugging Generic Units
-----------------------------

GNAT always uses code expansion for generic instantiation.  This means
that each time an instantiation occurs, a complete copy of the original
code is made, with appropriate substitutions of formals by actuals.

It is not possible to refer to the original generic entities in ‘GDB’,
but it is always possible to debug a particular instance of a generic,
by using the appropriate expanded names.  For example, if we have

          procedure g is

             generic package k is
                procedure kp (v1 : in out integer);
             end k;

             package body k is
                procedure kp (v1 : in out integer) is
                begin
                   v1 := v1 + 1;
                end kp;
             end k;

             package k1 is new k;
             package k2 is new k;

             var : integer := 1;

          begin
             k1.kp (var);
             k2.kp (var);
             k1.kp (var);
             k2.kp (var);
          end;

Then to break on a call to procedure kp in the k2 instance, simply use
the command:

          (gdb) break g.k2.kp

When the breakpoint occurs, you can step through the code of the
instance in the normal manner and examine the values of local variables,
as for other units.

6.1.10 Remote Debugging with gdbserver
--------------------------------------

On platforms where gdbserver is supported, it is possible to use this
tool to debug your application remotely.  This can be useful in
situations where the program needs to be run on a target host that is
different from the host used for development, particularly when the
target has a limited amount of resources (either CPU and/or memory).

To do so, start your program using gdbserver on the target machine.
gdbserver then automatically suspends the execution of your program at
its entry point, waiting for a debugger to connect to it.  The following
commands starts an application and tells gdbserver to wait for a
connection with the debugger on localhost port 4444.

          $ gdbserver localhost:4444 program
          Process program created; pid = 5685
          Listening on port 4444

Once gdbserver has started listening, we can tell the debugger to
establish a connection with this gdbserver, and then start the same
debugging session as if the program was being debugged on the same host,
directly under the control of GDB.

          $ gdb program
          (gdb) target remote targethost:4444
          Remote debugging using targethost:4444
          0x00007f29936d0af0 in ?? () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.
          (gdb) b foo.adb:3
          Breakpoint 1 at 0x401f0c: file foo.adb, line 3.
          (gdb) continue
          Continuing.

          Breakpoint 1, foo () at foo.adb:4
          4       end foo;

It is also possible to use gdbserver to attach to an already running
program, in which case the execution of that program is simply suspended
until the connection between the debugger and gdbserver is established.

For more information on how to use gdbserver, see the ‘Using the
gdbserver Program’ section in ‘Debugging with GDB’. GNAT provides
support for gdbserver on x86-linux, x86-windows and x86_64-linux.

6.1.11 GNAT Abnormal Termination or Failure to Terminate
--------------------------------------------------------

When presented with programs that contain serious errors in syntax or
semantics, GNAT may on rare occasions experience problems in operation,
such as aborting with a segmentation fault or illegal memory access,
raising an internal exception, terminating abnormally, or failing to
terminate at all.  In such cases, you can activate various features of
GNAT that can help you pinpoint the construct in your program that is
the likely source of the problem.

The following strategies are presented in increasing order of
difficulty, corresponding to your experience in using GNAT and your
familiarity with compiler internals.

   * Run ‘gcc’ with the ‘-gnatf’.  This first switch causes all errors
     on a given line to be reported.  In its absence, only the first
     error on a line is displayed.

     The ‘-gnatdO’ switch causes errors to be displayed as soon as they
     are encountered, rather than after compilation is terminated.  If
     GNAT terminates prematurely or goes into an infinite loop, the last
     error message displayed may help to pinpoint the culprit.

   * Run ‘gcc’ with the ‘-v’ (verbose) switch.  In this mode, ‘gcc’
     produces ongoing information about the progress of the compilation
     and provides the name of each procedure as code is generated.  This
     switch allows you to find which Ada procedure was being compiled
     when it encountered a code generation problem.

   * Run ‘gcc’ with the ‘-gnatdc’ switch.  This is a GNAT specific
     switch that does for the front-end what ‘-v’ does for the back end.
     The system prints the name of each unit, either a compilation unit
     or nested unit, as it is being analyzed.

   * Finally, you can start ‘gdb’ directly on the ‘gnat1’ executable.
     ‘gnat1’ is the front-end of GNAT, and can be run independently
     (normally it is just called from ‘gcc’).  You can use ‘gdb’ on
     ‘gnat1’ as you would on a C program (but *note The GNAT Debugger
     GDB: 151. for caveats).  The ‘where’ command is the first line of
     attack; the variable ‘lineno’ (seen by ‘print lineno’), used by the
     second phase of ‘gnat1’ and by the ‘gcc’ backend, indicates the
     source line at which the execution stopped, and ‘input_file name’
     indicates the name of the source file.

6.1.12 Naming Conventions for GNAT Source Files
-----------------------------------------------

In order to examine the workings of the GNAT system, the following brief
description of its organization may be helpful:

   * Files with prefix ‘sc’ contain the lexical scanner.

   * All files prefixed with ‘par’ are components of the parser.  The
     numbers correspond to chapters of the Ada Reference Manual.  For
     example, parsing of select statements can be found in
     ‘par-ch9.adb’.

   * All files prefixed with ‘sem’ perform semantic analysis.  The
     numbers correspond to chapters of the Ada standard.  For example,
     all issues involving context clauses can be found in
     ‘sem_ch10.adb’.  In addition, some features of the language require
     sufficient special processing to justify their own semantic files:
     sem_aggr for aggregates, sem_disp for dynamic dispatching, etc.

   * All files prefixed with ‘exp’ perform normalization and expansion
     of the intermediate representation (abstract syntax tree, or AST).
     these files use the same numbering scheme as the parser and
     semantics files.  For example, the construction of record
     initialization procedures is done in ‘exp_ch3.adb’.

   * The files prefixed with ‘bind’ implement the binder, which verifies
     the consistency of the compilation, determines an order of
     elaboration, and generates the bind file.

   * The files ‘atree.ads’ and ‘atree.adb’ detail the low-level data
     structures used by the front-end.

   * The files ‘sinfo.ads’ and ‘sinfo.adb’ detail the structure of the
     abstract syntax tree as produced by the parser.

   * The files ‘einfo.ads’ and ‘einfo.adb’ detail the attributes of all
     entities, computed during semantic analysis.

   * Library management issues are dealt with in files with prefix
     ‘lib’.

   * Ada files with the prefix ‘a-’ are children of ‘Ada’, as defined in
     Annex A.

   * Files with prefix ‘i-’ are children of ‘Interfaces’, as defined in
     Annex B.

   * Files with prefix ‘s-’ are children of ‘System’.  This includes
     both language-defined children and GNAT run-time routines.

   * Files with prefix ‘g-’ are children of ‘GNAT’.  These are useful
     general-purpose packages, fully documented in their specs.  All the
     other ‘.c’ files are modifications of common ‘gcc’ files.

6.1.13 Getting Internal Debugging Information
---------------------------------------------

Most compilers have internal debugging switches and modes.  GNAT does
also, except GNAT internal debugging switches and modes are not secret.
A summary and full description of all the compiler and binder debug
flags are in the file ‘debug.adb’.  You must obtain the sources of the
compiler to see the full detailed effects of these flags.

The switches that print the source of the program (reconstructed from
the internal tree) are of general interest for user programs, as are the
options to print the full internal tree, and the entity table (the
symbol table information).  The reconstructed source provides a readable
version of the program after the front-end has completed analysis and
expansion, and is useful when studying the performance of specific
constructs.  For example, constraint checks are indicated, complex
aggregates are replaced with loops and assignments, and tasking
primitives are replaced with run-time calls.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Stack Traceback,  Next: Pretty-Printers for the GNAT runtime,  Prev: Getting Internal Debugging Information,  Up: Running and Debugging Ada Programs

6.1.14 Stack Traceback
----------------------

Traceback is a mechanism to display the sequence of subprogram calls
that leads to a specified execution point in a program.  Often (but not
always) the execution point is an instruction at which an exception has
been raised.  This mechanism is also known as ‘stack unwinding’ because
it obtains its information by scanning the run-time stack and recovering
the activation records of all active subprograms.  Stack unwinding is
one of the most important tools for program debugging.

The first entry stored in traceback corresponds to the deepest calling
level, that is to say the subprogram currently executing the instruction
from which we want to obtain the traceback.

Note that there is no runtime performance penalty when stack traceback
is enabled, and no exception is raised during program execution.

6.1.14.1 Non-Symbolic Traceback
...............................

Note: this feature is not supported on all platforms.  See
‘GNAT.Traceback’ spec in ‘g-traceb.ads’ for a complete list of supported
platforms.

Tracebacks From an Unhandled Exception
......................................

A runtime non-symbolic traceback is a list of addresses of call
instructions.  To enable this feature you must use the ‘-E’ ‘gnatbind’
option.  With this option a stack traceback is stored as part of
exception information.

You can translate this information using the ‘addr2line’ tool, provided
that the program is compiled with debugging options (see *note Compiler
Switches: dd.) and linked at a fixed position with ‘-no-pie’.

Here is a simple example with ‘gnatmake’:

          procedure STB is

             procedure P1 is
             begin
                raise Constraint_Error;
             end P1;

             procedure P2 is
             begin
                P1;
             end P2;

          begin
             P2;
          end STB;

          $ gnatmake stb -g -bargs -E -largs -no-pie
          $ stb

          Execution of stb terminated by unhandled exception
          raised CONSTRAINT_ERROR : stb.adb:5 explicit raise
          Load address: 0x400000
          Call stack traceback locations:
          0x401373 0x40138b 0x40139c 0x401335 0x4011c4 0x4011f1 0x77e892a4

As we see the traceback lists a sequence of addresses for the unhandled
exception ‘CONSTRAINT_ERROR’ raised in procedure P1.  It is easy to
guess that this exception come from procedure P1.  To translate these
addresses into the source lines where the calls appear, the ‘addr2line’
tool needs to be invoked like this:

          $ addr2line -e stb 0x401373 0x40138b 0x40139c 0x401335 0x4011c4
             0x4011f1 0x77e892a4

          d:/stb/stb.adb:5
          d:/stb/stb.adb:10
          d:/stb/stb.adb:14
          d:/stb/b~stb.adb:197
          crtexe.c:?
          crtexe.c:?
          ??:0

The ‘addr2line’ tool has several other useful options:

     ‘-a --addresses’              to show the addresses alongside the line numbers
                                   
                                   
     ‘-f --functions’              to get the function name corresponding to a location
                                   
                                   
     ‘-p --pretty-print’           to print all the information on a single line
                                   
                                   
     ‘--demangle=gnat’             to use the GNAT decoding mode for the function names
                                   

          $ addr2line -e stb -a -f -p --demangle=gnat 0x401373 0x40138b
             0x40139c 0x401335 0x4011c4 0x4011f1 0x77e892a4

          0x00401373: stb.p1 at d:/stb/stb.adb:5
          0x0040138B: stb.p2 at d:/stb/stb.adb:10
          0x0040139C: stb at d:/stb/stb.adb:14
          0x00401335: main at d:/stb/b~stb.adb:197
          0x004011c4: ?? at crtexe.c:?
          0x004011f1: ?? at crtexe.c:?
          0x77e892a4: ?? ??:0

From this traceback we can see that the exception was raised in
‘stb.adb’ at line 5, which was reached from a procedure call in
‘stb.adb’ at line 10, and so on.  The ‘b~std.adb’ is the binder file,
which contains the call to the main program.  *note Running gnatbind:
110.  The remaining entries are assorted runtime routines and the output
will vary from platform to platform.

It is also possible to use ‘GDB’ with these traceback addresses to debug
the program.  For example, we can break at a given code location, as
reported in the stack traceback:

     $ gdb -nw stb

     (gdb) break *0x401373
     Breakpoint 1 at 0x401373: file stb.adb, line 5.

It is important to note that the stack traceback addresses do not change
when debug information is included.  This is particularly useful because
it makes it possible to release software without debug information (to
minimize object size), get a field report that includes a stack
traceback whenever an internal bug occurs, and then be able to retrieve
the sequence of calls with the same program compiled with debug
information.

However the ‘addr2line’ tool does not work with Position-Independent
Code (PIC), the historical example being Linux dynamic libraries and
Windows DLLs, which nowadays encompasse Position-Independent Executables
(PIE) on recent Linux and Windows versions.

In order to translate addresses the source lines with
Position-Independent Executables on recent Linux and Windows versions,
in other words without using the switch ‘-no-pie’ during linking, you
need to use the ‘gnatsymbolize’ tool with ‘--load’ instead of the
‘addr2line’ tool.  The main difference is that you need to copy the Load
Address output in the traceback ahead of the sequence of addresses.  And
the default mode of ‘gnatsymbolize’ is equivalent to that of ‘addr2line’
with the above switches, so none of them is needed:

     $ gnatmake stb -g -bargs -E
     $ stb

     Execution of stb terminated by unhandled exception
     raised CONSTRAINT_ERROR : stb.adb:5 explicit raise
     Load address: 0x400000
     Call stack traceback locations:
     0x401373 0x40138b 0x40139c 0x401335 0x4011c4 0x4011f1 0x77e892a4

     $ gnatsymbolize --load stb 0x400000 0x401373 0x40138b 0x40139c 0x401335 \

     0x77e892a4 ??? at ???

Tracebacks From Exception Occurrences
.....................................

Non-symbolic tracebacks are obtained by using the ‘-E’ binder argument.
The stack traceback is attached to the exception information string, and
can be retrieved in an exception handler within the Ada program, by
means of the Ada facilities defined in ‘Ada.Exceptions’.  Here is a
simple example:

          with Ada.Text_IO;
          with Ada.Exceptions;

          procedure STB is

             use Ada;
             use Ada.Exceptions;

             procedure P1 is
                K : Positive := 1;
             begin
                K := K - 1;
             exception
                when E : others =>
                   Text_IO.Put_Line (Exception_Information (E));
             end P1;

             procedure P2 is
             begin
                P1;
             end P2;

          begin
             P2;
          end STB;

          $ gnatmake stb -g -bargs -E -largs -no-pie
          $ stb

          raised CONSTRAINT_ERROR : stb.adb:12 range check failed
          Load address: 0x400000
          Call stack traceback locations:
          0x4015e4 0x401633 0x401644 0x401461 0x4011c4 0x4011f1 0x77e892a4

Tracebacks From Anywhere in a Program
.....................................

It is also possible to retrieve a stack traceback from anywhere in a
program.  For this you need to use the ‘GNAT.Traceback’ API. This
package includes a procedure called ‘Call_Chain’ that computes a
complete stack traceback, as well as useful display procedures described
below.  It is not necessary to use the ‘-E’ ‘gnatbind’ option in this
case, because the stack traceback mechanism is invoked explicitly.

In the following example we compute a traceback at a specific location
in the program, and we display it using ‘GNAT.Debug_Utilities.Image’ to
convert addresses to strings:

          with Ada.Text_IO;
          with GNAT.Traceback;
          with GNAT.Debug_Utilities;
          with System;

          procedure STB is

             use Ada;
             use Ada.Text_IO;
             use GNAT;
             use GNAT.Traceback;
             use System;

             LA : constant Address := Executable_Load_Address;

             procedure P1 is
                TB  : Tracebacks_Array (1 .. 10);
                --  We are asking for a maximum of 10 stack frames.
                Len : Natural;
                --  Len will receive the actual number of stack frames returned.
             begin
                Call_Chain (TB, Len);

                Put ("In STB.P1 : ");

                for K in 1 .. Len loop
                   Put (Debug_Utilities.Image_C (TB (K)));
                   Put (' ');
                end loop;

                New_Line;
             end P1;

             procedure P2 is
             begin
                P1;
             end P2;

          begin
             if LA /= Null_Address then
                Put_Line ("Load address: " & Debug_Utilities.Image_C (LA));
             end if;

             P2;
          end STB;

          $ gnatmake stb -g
          $ stb

          Load address: 0x400000
          In STB.P1 : 0x40F1E4 0x4014F2 0x40170B 0x40171C 0x401461 0x4011C4 \
            0x4011F1 0x77E892A4

You can then get further information by invoking the ‘addr2line’ tool or
the ‘gnatsymbolize’ tool as described earlier (note that the hexadecimal
addresses need to be specified in C format, with a leading ‘0x’).

6.1.14.2 Symbolic Traceback
...........................

A symbolic traceback is a stack traceback in which procedure names are
associated with each code location.

Note that this feature is not supported on all platforms.  See
‘GNAT.Traceback.Symbolic’ spec in ‘g-trasym.ads’ for a complete list of
currently supported platforms.

Note that the symbolic traceback requires that the program be compiled
with debug information.  If it is not compiled with debug information
only the non-symbolic information will be valid.

Tracebacks From Exception Occurrences
.....................................

Here is an example:

          with Ada.Text_IO;
          with GNAT.Traceback.Symbolic;

          procedure STB is

             procedure P1 is
             begin
                raise Constraint_Error;
             end P1;

             procedure P2 is
             begin
                P1;
             end P2;

             procedure P3 is
             begin
                P2;
             end P3;

          begin
             P3;
          exception
             when E : others =>
                Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (GNAT.Traceback.Symbolic.Symbolic_Traceback (E));
          end STB;

Tracebacks From Anywhere in a Program
.....................................

It is possible to get a symbolic stack traceback from anywhere in a
program, just as for non-symbolic tracebacks.  The first step is to
obtain a non-symbolic traceback, and then call ‘Symbolic_Traceback’ to
compute the symbolic information.  Here is an example:

          with Ada.Text_IO;
          with GNAT.Traceback;
          with GNAT.Traceback.Symbolic;

          procedure STB is

             use Ada;
             use GNAT.Traceback;
             use GNAT.Traceback.Symbolic;

             procedure P1 is
                TB  : Tracebacks_Array (1 .. 10);
                --  We are asking for a maximum of 10 stack frames.
                Len : Natural;
                --  Len will receive the actual number of stack frames returned.
             begin
                Call_Chain (TB, Len);
                Text_IO.Put_Line (Symbolic_Traceback (TB (1 .. Len)));
             end P1;

             procedure P2 is
             begin
                P1;
             end P2;

          begin
             P2;
          end STB;

Automatic Symbolic Tracebacks
.............................

Symbolic tracebacks may also be enabled by using the -Es switch to
gnatbind (as in ‘gprbuild -g ... -bargs -Es’).  This will cause the
Exception_Information to contain a symbolic traceback, which will also
be printed if an unhandled exception terminates the program.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Pretty-Printers for the GNAT runtime,  Prev: Stack Traceback,  Up: Running and Debugging Ada Programs

6.1.15 Pretty-Printers for the GNAT runtime
-------------------------------------------

As discussed in ‘Calling User-Defined Subprograms’, GDB’s ‘print’
command only knows about the physical layout of program data structures
and therefore normally displays only low-level dumps, which are often
hard to understand.

An example of this is when trying to display the contents of an Ada
standard container, such as ‘Ada.Containers.Ordered_Maps.Map’:

          with Ada.Containers.Ordered_Maps;

          procedure PP is
             package Int_To_Nat is
                new Ada.Containers.Ordered_Maps (Integer, Natural);

             Map : Int_To_Nat.Map;
          begin
             Map.Insert (1, 10);
             Map.Insert (2, 20);
             Map.Insert (3, 30);

             Map.Clear; --  BREAK HERE
          end PP;

When this program is built with debugging information and run under GDB
up to the ‘Map.Clear’ statement, trying to print ‘Map’ will yield
information that is only relevant to the developers of our standard
containers:

          (gdb) print map
          $1 = (
            tree => (
              first => 0x64e010,
              last => 0x64e070,
              root => 0x64e040,
              length => 3,
              tc => (
                busy => 0,
                lock => 0
              )
            )
          )

Fortunately, GDB has a feature called pretty-printers(1), which allows
customizing how GDB displays data structures.  The GDB shipped with GNAT
embeds such pretty-printers for the most common containers in the
standard library.  To enable them, either run the following command
manually under GDB or add it to your ‘.gdbinit’ file:

          python import gnatdbg; gnatdbg.setup()

Once this is done, GDB’s ‘print’ command will automatically use these
pretty-printers when appropriate.  Using the previous example:

          (gdb) print map
          $1 = pp.int_to_nat.map of length 3 = {
            [1] = 10,
            [2] = 20,
            [3] = 30
          }

Pretty-printers are invoked each time GDB tries to display a value,
including when displaying the arguments of a called subprogram (in GDB’s
‘backtrace’ command) or when printing the value returned by a function
(in GDB’s ‘finish’ command).

To display a value without involving pretty-printers, ‘print’ can be
invoked with its ‘/r’ option:

          (gdb) print/r map
          $1 = (
            tree => (...

Finer control of pretty-printers is also possible: see GDB’s online
documentation(2) for more information.

6.2 Profiling
=============

This section describes how to use the ‘gprof’ profiler tool on Ada
programs.

* Menu:

* Profiling an Ada Program with gprof::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Profiling an Ada Program with gprof,  Up: Profiling

6.2.1 Profiling an Ada Program with gprof
-----------------------------------------

This section is not meant to be an exhaustive documentation of ‘gprof’.
Full documentation for it can be found in the ‘GNU Profiler User’s
Guide’ documentation that is part of this GNAT distribution.

Profiling a program helps determine the parts of a program that are
executed most often, and are therefore the most time-consuming.

‘gprof’ is the standard GNU profiling tool; it has been enhanced to
better handle Ada programs and multitasking.  It is currently supported
on the following platforms

   * Linux x86/x86_64

   * Windows x86/x86_64 (without PIE support)

In order to profile a program using ‘gprof’, several steps are needed:

  1. Instrument the code, which requires a full recompilation of the
     project with the proper switches.

  2. Execute the program under the analysis conditions, i.e.  with the
     desired input.

  3. Analyze the results using the ‘gprof’ tool.

The following sections detail the different steps, and indicate how to
interpret the results.

* Menu:

* Compilation for profiling::
* Program execution::
* Running gprof::
* Interpretation of profiling results::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Compilation for profiling,  Next: Program execution,  Up: Profiling an Ada Program with gprof

6.2.1.1 Compilation for profiling
.................................

In order to profile a program the first step is to tell the compiler to
generate the necessary profiling information.  The compiler switch to be
used is ‘-pg’, which must be added to other compilation switches.  This
switch needs to be specified both during compilation and link stages,
and can be specified once when using gnatmake:

          $ gnatmake -f -pg -P my_project

Note that only the objects that were compiled with the ‘-pg’ switch will
be profiled; if you need to profile your whole project, use the ‘-f’
gnatmake switch to force full recompilation.

Note that on Windows, gprof does not support PIE. The ‘-no-pie’ switch
should be added to the linker flags to disable this feature.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Program execution,  Next: Running gprof,  Prev: Compilation for profiling,  Up: Profiling an Ada Program with gprof

6.2.1.2 Program execution
.........................

Once the program has been compiled for profiling, you can run it as
usual.

The only constraint imposed by profiling is that the program must
terminate normally.  An interrupted program (via a Ctrl-C, kill, etc.)
will not be properly analyzed.

Once the program completes execution, a data file called ‘gmon.out’ is
generated in the directory where the program was launched from.  If this
file already exists, it will be overwritten.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Running gprof,  Next: Interpretation of profiling results,  Prev: Program execution,  Up: Profiling an Ada Program with gprof

6.2.1.3 Running gprof
.....................

The ‘gprof’ tool is called as follow:

          $ gprof my_prog gmon.out

or simply:

          $ gprof my_prog

The complete form of the gprof command line is the following:

          $ gprof [switches] [executable [data-file]]

‘gprof’ supports numerous switches.  The order of these switch does not
matter.  The full list of options can be found in the GNU Profiler
User’s Guide documentation that comes with this documentation.

The following is the subset of those switches that is most relevant:

‘--demangle[=STYLE]’, ‘--no-demangle’

     These options control whether symbol names should be demangled when
     printing output.  The default is to demangle C++ symbols.  The
     ‘--no-demangle’ option may be used to turn off demangling.
     Different compilers have different mangling styles.  The optional
     demangling style argument can be used to choose an appropriate
     demangling style for your compiler, in particular Ada symbols
     generated by GNAT can be demangled using ‘--demangle=gnat’.

‘-e FUNCTION_NAME’

     The ‘-e FUNCTION’ option tells ‘gprof’ not to print information
     about the function ‘function_name’ (and its children…) in the call
     graph.  The function will still be listed as a child of any
     functions that call it, but its index number will be shown as ‘[not
     printed]’.  More than one ‘-e’ option may be given; only one
     ‘function_name’ may be indicated with each ‘-e’ option.

‘-E FUNCTION_NAME’

     The ‘-E FUNCTION’ option works like the ‘-e’ option, but execution
     time spent in the function (and children who were not called from
     anywhere else), will not be used to compute the percentages-of-time
     for the call graph.  More than one ‘-E’ option may be given; only
     one ‘function_name’ may be indicated with each ‘-E`’ option.

‘-f FUNCTION_NAME’

     The ‘-f FUNCTION’ option causes ‘gprof’ to limit the call graph to
     the function ‘function_name’ and its children (and their
     children…).  More than one ‘-f’ option may be given; only one
     ‘function_name’ may be indicated with each ‘-f’ option.

‘-F FUNCTION_NAME’

     The ‘-F FUNCTION’ option works like the ‘-f’ option, but only time
     spent in the function and its children (and their children…) will
     be used to determine total-time and percentages-of-time for the
     call graph.  More than one ‘-F’ option may be given; only one
     ‘function_name’ may be indicated with each ‘-F’ option.  The ‘-F’
     option overrides the ‘-E’ option.

6.2.1.4 Interpretation of profiling results
...........................................

The results of the profiling analysis are represented by two arrays: the
‘flat profile’ and the ‘call graph’.  Full documentation of those
outputs can be found in the GNU Profiler User’s Guide.

The flat profile shows the time spent in each function of the program,
and how many time it has been called.  This allows you to locate easily
the most time-consuming functions.

The call graph shows, for each subprogram, the subprograms that call it,
and the subprograms that it calls.  It also provides an estimate of the
time spent in each of those callers/called subprograms.

6.3 Improving Performance
=========================

This section presents several topics related to program performance.  It
first describes some of the tradeoffs that need to be considered and
some of the techniques for making your program run faster.

It then documents the unused subprogram/data elimination feature, which
can reduce the size of program executables.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Performance Considerations,  Next: Text_IO Suggestions,  Up: Improving Performance

6.3.1 Performance Considerations
--------------------------------

The GNAT system provides a number of options that allow a trade-off
between

   * performance of the generated code

   * speed of compilation

   * minimization of dependences and recompilation

   * the degree of run-time checking.

The defaults (if no options are selected) aim at improving the speed of
compilation and minimizing dependences, at the expense of performance of
the generated code:

   * no optimization

   * no inlining of subprogram calls

   * all run-time checks enabled except overflow and elaboration checks

These options are suitable for most program development purposes.  This
section describes how you can modify these choices, and also provides
some guidelines on debugging optimized code.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Controlling Run-Time Checks,  Next: Use of Restrictions,  Up: Performance Considerations

6.3.1.1 Controlling Run-Time Checks
...................................

By default, GNAT generates all run-time checks, except stack overflow
checks, and checks for access before elaboration on subprogram calls.
The latter are not required in default mode, because all necessary
checking is done at compile time.

The gnat switch, ‘-gnatp’ allows this default to be modified.  See *note
Run-Time Checks: ec.

Our experience is that the default is suitable for most development
purposes.

Elaboration checks are off by default, and also not needed by default,
since GNAT uses a static elaboration analysis approach that avoids the
need for run-time checking.  This manual contains a full chapter
discussing the issue of elaboration checks, and if the default is not
satisfactory for your use, you should read this chapter.

For validity checks, the minimal checks required by the Ada Reference
Manual (for case statements and assignments to array elements) are on by
default.  These can be suppressed by use of the ‘-gnatVn’ switch.  Note
that in Ada 83, there were no validity checks, so if the Ada 83 mode is
acceptable (or when comparing GNAT performance with an Ada 83 compiler),
it may be reasonable to routinely use ‘-gnatVn’.  Validity checks are
also suppressed entirely if ‘-gnatp’ is used.

Note that the setting of the switches controls the default setting of
the checks.  They may be modified using either ‘pragma Suppress’ (to
remove checks) or ‘pragma Unsuppress’ (to add back suppressed checks) in
the program source.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Use of Restrictions,  Next: Optimization Levels,  Prev: Controlling Run-Time Checks,  Up: Performance Considerations

6.3.1.2 Use of Restrictions
...........................

The use of pragma Restrictions allows you to control which features are
permitted in your program.  Apart from the obvious point that if you
avoid relatively expensive features like finalization (enforceable by
the use of pragma Restrictions (No_Finalization)), the use of this
pragma does not affect the generated code in most cases.

One notable exception to this rule is that the possibility of task abort
results in some distributed overhead, particularly if finalization or
exception handlers are used.  The reason is that certain sections of
code have to be marked as non-abortable.

If you use neither the ‘abort’ statement, nor asynchronous transfer of
control (‘select ... then abort’), then this distributed overhead is
removed, which may have a general positive effect in improving overall
performance.  Especially code involving frequent use of tasking
constructs and controlled types will show much improved performance.
The relevant restrictions pragmas are

          pragma Restrictions (No_Abort_Statements);
          pragma Restrictions (Max_Asynchronous_Select_Nesting => 0);

It is recommended that these restriction pragmas be used if possible.
Note that this also means that you can write code without worrying about
the possibility of an immediate abort at any point.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Optimization Levels,  Next: Debugging Optimized Code,  Prev: Use of Restrictions,  Up: Performance Considerations

6.3.1.3 Optimization Levels
...........................

Without any optimization option, the compiler’s goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
change the program counter to any other statement in the subprogram and
get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.

Turning on optimization makes the compiler attempt to improve the
performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and
possibly the ability to debug the program.

If you use multiple -O options, with or without level numbers, the last
such option is the one that is effective.

The default is optimization off.  This results in the fastest compile
times, but GNAT makes absolutely no attempt to optimize, and the
generated programs are considerably larger and slower than when
optimization is enabled.  You can use the ‘-O’ switch (the permitted
forms are ‘-O0’, ‘-O1’ ‘-O2’, ‘-O3’, and ‘-Os’) to ‘gcc’ to control the
optimization level:

   * 
     ‘-O0’

          No optimization (the default); generates unoptimized code but
          has the fastest compilation time.

          Note that many other compilers do substantial optimization
          even if ‘no optimization’ is specified.  With gcc, it is very
          unusual to use ‘-O0’ for production if execution time is of
          any concern, since ‘-O0’ means (almost) no optimization.  This
          difference between gcc and other compilers should be kept in
          mind when doing performance comparisons.

   * 
     ‘-O1’

          Moderate optimization; optimizes reasonably well but does not
          degrade compilation time significantly.

   * 
     ‘-O2’

          Full optimization; generates highly optimized code and has the
          slowest compilation time.

   * 
     ‘-O3’

          Full optimization as in ‘-O2’; also uses more aggressive
          automatic inlining of subprograms within a unit (*note
          Inlining of Subprograms: 102.) and attempts to vectorize
          loops.

   * 
     ‘-Os’

          Optimize space usage (code and data) of resulting program.

Higher optimization levels perform more global transformations on the
program and apply more expensive analysis algorithms in order to
generate faster and more compact code.  The price in compilation time,
and the resulting improvement in execution time, both depend on the
particular application and the hardware environment.  You should
experiment to find the best level for your application.

Since the precise set of optimizations done at each level will vary from
release to release (and sometime from target to target), it is best to
think of the optimization settings in general terms.  See the ‘Options
That Control Optimization’ section in ‘Using the GNU Compiler Collection
(GCC)’ for details about the ‘-O’ settings and a number of ‘-f’ options
that individually enable or disable specific optimizations.

Unlike some other compilation systems, ‘gcc’ has been tested extensively
at all optimization levels.  There are some bugs which appear only with
optimization turned on, but there have also been bugs which show up only
in ‘unoptimized’ code.  Selecting a lower level of optimization does not
improve the reliability of the code generator, which in practice is
highly reliable at all optimization levels.

Note regarding the use of ‘-O3’: The use of this optimization level
ought not to be automatically preferred over that of level ‘-O2’, since
it often results in larger executables which may run more slowly.  See
further discussion of this point in *note Inlining of Subprograms: 102.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Debugging Optimized Code,  Next: Inlining of Subprograms,  Prev: Optimization Levels,  Up: Performance Considerations

6.3.1.4 Debugging Optimized Code
................................

Although it is possible to do a reasonable amount of debugging at
nonzero optimization levels, the higher the level the more likely that
source-level constructs will have been eliminated by optimization.  For
example, if a loop is strength-reduced, the loop control variable may be
completely eliminated and thus cannot be displayed in the debugger.
This can only happen at ‘-O2’ or ‘-O3’.  Explicit temporary variables
that you code might be eliminated at level ‘-O1’ or higher.

The use of the ‘-g’ switch, which is needed for source-level debugging,
affects the size of the program executable on disk, and indeed the
debugging information can be quite large.  However, it has no effect on
the generated code (and thus does not degrade performance)

Since the compiler generates debugging tables for a compilation unit
before it performs optimizations, the optimizing transformations may
invalidate some of the debugging data.  You therefore need to anticipate
certain anomalous situations that may arise while debugging optimized
code.  These are the most common cases:

   * ‘The ‘hopping Program Counter’:’ Repeated ‘step’ or ‘next’ commands
     show the PC bouncing back and forth in the code.  This may result
     from any of the following optimizations:

        - ‘Common subexpression elimination:’ using a single instance of
          code for a quantity that the source computes several times.
          As a result you may not be able to stop on what looks like a
          statement.

        - ‘Invariant code motion:’ moving an expression that does not
          change within a loop, to the beginning of the loop.

        - ‘Instruction scheduling:’ moving instructions so as to overlap
          loads and stores (typically) with other code, or in general to
          move computations of values closer to their uses.  Often this
          causes you to pass an assignment statement without the
          assignment happening and then later bounce back to the
          statement when the value is actually needed.  Placing a
          breakpoint on a line of code and then stepping over it may,
          therefore, not always cause all the expected side-effects.

   * ‘The ‘big leap’:’ More commonly known as ‘cross-jumping’, in which
     two identical pieces of code are merged and the program counter
     suddenly jumps to a statement that is not supposed to be executed,
     simply because it (and the code following) translates to the same
     thing as the code that ‘was’ supposed to be executed.  This effect
     is typically seen in sequences that end in a jump, such as a
     ‘goto’, a ‘return’, or a ‘break’ in a C ‘switch’ statement.

   * ‘The ‘roving variable’:’ The symptom is an unexpected value in a
     variable.  There are various reasons for this effect:

        - In a subprogram prologue, a parameter may not yet have been
          moved to its ‘home’.

        - A variable may be dead, and its register re-used.  This is
          probably the most common cause.

        - As mentioned above, the assignment of a value to a variable
          may have been moved.

        - A variable may be eliminated entirely by value propagation or
          other means.  In this case, GCC may incorrectly generate
          debugging information for the variable

     In general, when an unexpected value appears for a local variable
     or parameter you should first ascertain if that value was actually
     computed by your program, as opposed to being incorrectly reported
     by the debugger.  Record fields or array elements in an object
     designated by an access value are generally less of a problem, once
     you have ascertained that the access value is sensible.  Typically,
     this means checking variables in the preceding code and in the
     calling subprogram to verify that the value observed is explainable
     from other values (one must apply the procedure recursively to
     those other values); or re-running the code and stopping a little
     earlier (perhaps before the call) and stepping to better see how
     the variable obtained the value in question; or continuing to step
     ‘from’ the point of the strange value to see if code motion had
     simply moved the variable’s assignments later.

In light of such anomalies, a recommended technique is to use ‘-O0’
early in the software development cycle, when extensive debugging
capabilities are most needed, and then move to ‘-O1’ and later ‘-O2’ as
the debugger becomes less critical.  Whether to use the ‘-g’ switch in
the release version is a release management issue.  Note that if you use
‘-g’ you can then use the ‘strip’ program on the resulting executable,
which removes both debugging information and global symbols.

6.3.1.5 Inlining of Subprograms
...............................

A call to a subprogram in the current unit is inlined if all the
following conditions are met:

   * The optimization level is at least ‘-O1’.

   * The called subprogram is suitable for inlining: It must be small
     enough and not contain something that ‘gcc’ cannot support in
     inlined subprograms.

   * Any one of the following applies: ‘pragma Inline’ is applied to the
     subprogram; the subprogram is local to the unit and called once
     from within it; the subprogram is small and optimization level
     ‘-O2’ is specified; optimization level ‘-O3’ is specified.

Calls to subprograms in ‘with’ed units are normally not inlined.  To
achieve actual inlining (that is, replacement of the call by the code in
the body of the subprogram), the following conditions must all be true:

   * The optimization level is at least ‘-O1’.

   * The called subprogram is suitable for inlining: It must be small
     enough and not contain something that ‘gcc’ cannot support in
     inlined subprograms.

   * There is a ‘pragma Inline’ for the subprogram.

   * The ‘-gnatn’ switch is used on the command line.

Even if all these conditions are met, it may not be possible for the
compiler to inline the call, due to the length of the body, or features
in the body that make it impossible for the compiler to do the inlining.

Note that specifying the ‘-gnatn’ switch causes additional compilation
dependencies.  Consider the following:

          package R is
             procedure Q;
             pragma Inline (Q);
          end R;
          package body R is
             ...
          end R;

          with R;
          procedure Main is
          begin
             ...
             R.Q;
          end Main;

With the default behavior (no ‘-gnatn’ switch specified), the
compilation of the ‘Main’ procedure depends only on its own source,
‘main.adb’, and the spec of the package in file ‘r.ads’.  This means
that editing the body of ‘R’ does not require recompiling ‘Main’.

On the other hand, the call ‘R.Q’ is not inlined under these
circumstances.  If the ‘-gnatn’ switch is present when ‘Main’ is
compiled, the call will be inlined if the body of ‘Q’ is small enough,
but now ‘Main’ depends on the body of ‘R’ in ‘r.adb’ as well as on the
spec.  This means that if this body is edited, the main program must be
recompiled.  Note that this extra dependency occurs whether or not the
call is in fact inlined by ‘gcc’.

The use of front end inlining with ‘-gnatN’ generates similar additional
dependencies.

Note: The ‘-fno-inline’ switch overrides all other conditions and
ensures that no inlining occurs, unless requested with pragma
Inline_Always for ‘gcc’ back-ends.  The extra dependences resulting from
‘-gnatn’ will still be active, even if this switch is used to suppress
the resulting inlining actions.

Note: The ‘-fno-inline-functions’ switch can be used to prevent
automatic inlining of subprograms if ‘-O3’ is used.

Note: The ‘-fno-inline-small-functions’ switch can be used to prevent
automatic inlining of small subprograms if ‘-O2’ is used.

Note: The ‘-fno-inline-functions-called-once’ switch can be used to
prevent inlining of subprograms local to the unit and called once from
within it if ‘-O1’ is used.

Note regarding the use of ‘-O3’: ‘-gnatn’ is made up of two sub-switches
‘-gnatn1’ and ‘-gnatn2’ that can be directly specified in lieu of it,
‘-gnatn’ being translated into one of them based on the optimization
level.  With ‘-O2’ or below, ‘-gnatn’ is equivalent to ‘-gnatn1’ which
activates pragma ‘Inline’ with moderate inlining across modules.  With
‘-O3’, ‘-gnatn’ is equivalent to ‘-gnatn2’ which activates pragma
‘Inline’ with full inlining across modules.  If you have used pragma
‘Inline’ in appropriate cases, then it is usually much better to use
‘-O2’ and ‘-gnatn’ and avoid the use of ‘-O3’ which has the additional
effect of inlining subprograms you did not think should be inlined.  We
have found that the use of ‘-O3’ may slow down the compilation and
increase the code size by performing excessive inlining, leading to
increased instruction cache pressure from the increased code size and
thus minor performance improvements.  So the bottom line here is that
you should not automatically assume that ‘-O3’ is better than ‘-O2’, and
indeed you should use ‘-O3’ only if tests show that it actually improves
performance for your program.

6.3.1.6 Floating Point Operations
.................................

On almost all targets, GNAT maps Float and Long_Float to the 32-bit and
64-bit standard IEEE floating-point representations, and operations will
use standard IEEE arithmetic as provided by the processor.  On most, but
not all, architectures, the attribute Machine_Overflows is False for
these types, meaning that the semantics of overflow is
implementation-defined.  In the case of GNAT, these semantics correspond
to the normal IEEE treatment of infinities and NaN (not a number)
values.  For example, 1.0 / 0.0 yields plus infinitiy and 0.0 / 0.0
yields a NaN. By avoiding explicit overflow checks, the performance is
greatly improved on many targets.  However, if required, floating-point
overflow can be enabled by the use of the pragma Check_Float_Overflow.

Another consideration that applies specifically to x86 32-bit
architectures is which form of floating-point arithmetic is used.  By
default the operations use the old style x86 floating-point, which
implements an 80-bit extended precision form (on these architectures the
type Long_Long_Float corresponds to that form).  In addition, generation
of efficient code in this mode means that the extended precision form
will be used for intermediate results.  This may be helpful in improving
the final precision of a complex expression.  However it means that the
results obtained on the x86 will be different from those on other
architectures, and for some algorithms, the extra intermediate precision
can be detrimental.

In addition to this old-style floating-point, all modern x86 chips
implement an alternative floating-point operation model referred to as
SSE2.  In this model there is no extended form, and furthermore
execution performance is significantly enhanced.  To force GNAT to use
this more modern form, use both of the switches:

     -msse2 -mfpmath=sse

A unit compiled with these switches will automatically use the more
efficient SSE2 instruction set for Float and Long_Float operations.
Note that the ABI has the same form for both floating-point models, so
it is permissible to mix units compiled with and without these switches.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Vectorization of loops,  Next: Other Optimization Switches,  Prev: Floating Point Operations,  Up: Performance Considerations

6.3.1.7 Vectorization of loops
..............................

You can take advantage of the auto-vectorizer present in the ‘gcc’ back
end to vectorize loops with GNAT. The corresponding command line switch
is ‘-ftree-vectorize’ but, as it is enabled by default at ‘-O3’ and
other aggressive optimizations helpful for vectorization also are
enabled by default at this level, using ‘-O3’ directly is recommended.

You also need to make sure that the target architecture features a
supported SIMD instruction set.  For example, for the x86 architecture,
you should at least specify ‘-msse2’ to get significant vectorization
(but you don’t need to specify it for x86-64 as it is part of the base
64-bit architecture).  Similarly, for the PowerPC architecture, you
should specify ‘-maltivec’.

The preferred loop form for vectorization is the ‘for’ iteration scheme.
Loops with a ‘while’ iteration scheme can also be vectorized if they are
very simple, but the vectorizer will quickly give up otherwise.  With
either iteration scheme, the flow of control must be straight, in
particular no ‘exit’ statement may appear in the loop body.  The loop
may however contain a single nested loop, if it can be vectorized when
considered alone:

          A : array (1..4, 1..4) of Long_Float;
          S : array (1..4) of Long_Float;

          procedure Sum is
          begin
             for I in A'Range(1) loop
                for J in A'Range(2) loop
                   S (I) := S (I) + A (I, J);
                end loop;
             end loop;
          end Sum;

The vectorizable operations depend on the targeted SIMD instruction set,
but the adding and some of the multiplying operators are generally
supported, as well as the logical operators for modular types.  Note
that compiling with ‘-gnatp’ might well reveal cases where some checks
do thwart vectorization.

Type conversions may also prevent vectorization if they involve
semantics that are not directly supported by the code generator or the
SIMD instruction set.  A typical example is direct conversion from
floating-point to integer types.  The solution in this case is to use
the following idiom:

          Integer (S'Truncation (F))

if ‘S’ is the subtype of floating-point object ‘F’.

In most cases, the vectorizable loops are loops that iterate over
arrays.  All kinds of array types are supported, i.e.  constrained array
types with static bounds:

          type Array_Type is array (1 .. 4) of Long_Float;

constrained array types with dynamic bounds:

          type Array_Type is array (1 .. Q.N) of Long_Float;

          type Array_Type is array (Q.K .. 4) of Long_Float;

          type Array_Type is array (Q.K .. Q.N) of Long_Float;

or unconstrained array types:

          type Array_Type is array (Positive range <>) of Long_Float;

The quality of the generated code decreases when the dynamic aspect of
the array type increases, the worst code being generated for
unconstrained array types.  This is so because, the less information the
compiler has about the bounds of the array, the more fallback code it
needs to generate in order to fix things up at run time.

It is possible to specify that a given loop should be subject to
vectorization preferably to other optimizations by means of pragma
‘Loop_Optimize’:

          pragma Loop_Optimize (Vector);

placed immediately within the loop will convey the appropriate hint to
the compiler for this loop.

It is also possible to help the compiler generate better vectorized code
for a given loop by asserting that there are no loop-carried
dependencies in the loop.  Consider for example the procedure:

          type Arr is array (1 .. 4) of Long_Float;

          procedure Add (X, Y : not null access Arr; R : not null access Arr) is
          begin
            for I in Arr'Range loop
              R(I) := X(I) + Y(I);
            end loop;
          end;

By default, the compiler cannot unconditionally vectorize the loop
because assigning to a component of the array designated by R in one
iteration could change the value read from the components of the array
designated by X or Y in a later iteration.  As a result, the compiler
will generate two versions of the loop in the object code, one
vectorized and the other not vectorized, as well as a test to select the
appropriate version at run time.  This can be overcome by another hint:

          pragma Loop_Optimize (Ivdep);

placed immediately within the loop will tell the compiler that it can
safely omit the non-vectorized version of the loop as well as the
run-time test.

6.3.1.8 Other Optimization Switches
...................................

Since GNAT uses the ‘gcc’ back end, all the specialized ‘gcc’
optimization switches are potentially usable.  These switches have not
been extensively tested with GNAT but can generally be expected to work.
Examples of switches in this category are ‘-funroll-loops’ and the
various target-specific ‘-m’ options (in particular, it has been
observed that ‘-march=xxx’ can significantly improve performance on
appropriate machines).  For full details of these switches, see the
‘Submodel Options’ section in the ‘Hardware Models and Configurations’
chapter of ‘Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)’.

6.3.1.9 Optimization and Strict Aliasing
........................................

The strong typing capabilities of Ada allow an optimizer to generate
efficient code in situations where other languages would be forced to
make worst case assumptions preventing such optimizations.  Consider the
following example:

          procedure R is
             type Int1 is new Integer;
             type Int2 is new Integer;
             type Int1A is access Int1;
             type Int2A is access Int2;
             Int1V : Int1A;
             Int2V : Int2A;
             ...

          begin
             ...
             for J in Data'Range loop
                if Data (J) = Int1V.all then
                   Int2V.all := Int2V.all + 1;
                end if;
             end loop;
             ...
          end R;

In this example, since the variable ‘Int1V’ can only access objects of
type ‘Int1’, and ‘Int2V’ can only access objects of type ‘Int2’, there
is no possibility that the assignment to ‘Int2V.all’ affects the value
of ‘Int1V.all’.  This means that the compiler optimizer can “know” that
the value ‘Int1V.all’ is constant for all iterations of the loop and
avoid the extra memory reference required to dereference it each time
through the loop.

This kind of optimization, called strict aliasing analysis, is triggered
by specifying an optimization level of ‘-O2’ or higher or ‘-Os’ and
allows GNAT to generate more efficient code when access values are
involved.

However, although this optimization is always correct in terms of the
formal semantics of the Ada Reference Manual, difficulties can arise if
features like ‘Unchecked_Conversion’ are used to break the typing
system.  Consider the following complete program example:

          package p1 is
             type int1 is new integer;
             type int2 is new integer;
             type a1 is access int1;
             type a2 is access int2;
          end p1;

          with p1; use p1;
          package p2 is
             function to_a2 (Input : a1) return a2;
          end p2;

          with Ada.Unchecked_Conversion;
          package body p2 is
             function to_a2 (Input : a1) return a2 is
                function to_a2u is
                  new Ada.Unchecked_Conversion (a1, a2);
             begin
                return to_a2u (Input);
             end to_a2;
          end p2;

          with p2; use p2;
          with p1; use p1;
          with Text_IO; use Text_IO;
          procedure m is
             v1 : a1 := new int1;
             v2 : a2 := to_a2 (v1);
          begin
             v1.all := 1;
             v2.all := 0;
             put_line (int1'image (v1.all));
          end;

This program prints out 0 in ‘-O0’ or ‘-O1’ mode, but it prints out 1 in
‘-O2’ mode.  That’s because in strict aliasing mode, the compiler can
and does assume that the assignment to ‘v2.all’ could not affect the
value of ‘v1.all’, since different types are involved.

This behavior is not a case of non-conformance with the standard, since
the Ada RM specifies that an unchecked conversion where the resulting
bit pattern is not a correct value of the target type can result in an
abnormal value and attempting to reference an abnormal value makes the
execution of a program erroneous.  That’s the case here since the result
does not point to an object of type ‘int2’.  This means that the effect
is entirely unpredictable.

However, although that explanation may satisfy a language lawyer, in
practice an applications programmer expects an unchecked conversion
involving pointers to create true aliases and the behavior of printing 1
seems plain wrong.  In this case, the strict aliasing optimization is
unwelcome.

Indeed the compiler recognizes this possibility, and the unchecked
conversion generates a warning:

          p2.adb:5:07: warning: possible aliasing problem with type "a2"
          p2.adb:5:07: warning: use -fno-strict-aliasing switch for references
          p2.adb:5:07: warning:  or use "pragma No_Strict_Aliasing (a2);"

Unfortunately the problem is recognized when compiling the body of
package ‘p2’, but the actual “bad” code is generated while compiling the
body of ‘m’ and this latter compilation does not see the suspicious
‘Unchecked_Conversion’.

As implied by the warning message, there are approaches you can use to
avoid the unwanted strict aliasing optimization in a case like this.

One possibility is to simply avoid the use of ‘-O2’, but that is a bit
drastic, since it throws away a number of useful optimizations that do
not involve strict aliasing assumptions.

A less drastic approach is to compile the program using the option
‘-fno-strict-aliasing’.  Actually it is only the unit containing the
dereferencing of the suspicious pointer that needs to be compiled.  So
in this case, if we compile unit ‘m’ with this switch, then we get the
expected value of zero printed.  Analyzing which units might need the
switch can be painful, so a more reasonable approach is to compile the
entire program with options ‘-O2’ and ‘-fno-strict-aliasing’.  If the
performance is satisfactory with this combination of options, then the
advantage is that the entire issue of possible “wrong” optimization due
to strict aliasing is avoided.

To avoid the use of compiler switches, the configuration pragma
‘No_Strict_Aliasing’ with no parameters may be used to specify that for
all access types, the strict aliasing optimization should be suppressed.

However, these approaches are still overkill, in that they causes all
manipulations of all access values to be deoptimized.  A more refined
approach is to concentrate attention on the specific access type
identified as problematic.

First, if a careful analysis of uses of the pointer shows that there are
no possible problematic references, then the warning can be suppressed
by bracketing the instantiation of ‘Unchecked_Conversion’ to turn the
warning off:

          pragma Warnings (Off);
          function to_a2u is
            new Ada.Unchecked_Conversion (a1, a2);
          pragma Warnings (On);

Of course that approach is not appropriate for this particular example,
since indeed there is a problematic reference.  In this case we can take
one of two other approaches.

The first possibility is to move the instantiation of unchecked
conversion to the unit in which the type is declared.  In this example,
we would move the instantiation of ‘Unchecked_Conversion’ from the body
of package ‘p2’ to the spec of package ‘p1’.  Now the warning
disappears.  That’s because any use of the access type knows there is a
suspicious unchecked conversion, and the strict aliasing optimization is
automatically suppressed for the type.

If it is not practical to move the unchecked conversion to the same unit
in which the destination access type is declared (perhaps because the
source type is not visible in that unit), you may use pragma
‘No_Strict_Aliasing’ for the type.  This pragma must occur in the same
declarative sequence as the declaration of the access type:

          type a2 is access int2;
          pragma No_Strict_Aliasing (a2);

Here again, the compiler now knows that the strict aliasing optimization
should be suppressed for any reference to type ‘a2’ and the expected
behavior is obtained.

Finally, note that although the compiler can generate warnings for
simple cases of unchecked conversions, there are tricker and more
indirect ways of creating type incorrect aliases which the compiler
cannot detect.  Examples are the use of address overlays and unchecked
conversions involving composite types containing access types as
components.  In such cases, no warnings are generated, but there can
still be aliasing problems.  One safe coding practice is to forbid the
use of address clauses for type overlaying, and to allow unchecked
conversion only for primitive types.  This is not really a significant
restriction since any possible desired effect can be achieved by
unchecked conversion of access values.

The aliasing analysis done in strict aliasing mode can certainly have
significant benefits.  We have seen cases of large scale application
code where the time is increased by up to 5% by turning this
optimization off.  If you have code that includes significant usage of
unchecked conversion, you might want to just stick with ‘-O1’ and avoid
the entire issue.  If you get adequate performance at this level of
optimization level, that’s probably the safest approach.  If tests show
that you really need higher levels of optimization, then you can
experiment with ‘-O2’ and ‘-O2 -fno-strict-aliasing’ to see how much
effect this has on size and speed of the code.  If you really need to
use ‘-O2’ with strict aliasing in effect, then you should review any
uses of unchecked conversion of access types, particularly if you are
getting the warnings described above.

6.3.1.10 Aliased Variables and Optimization
...........................................

There are scenarios in which programs may use low level techniques to
modify variables that otherwise might be considered to be unassigned.
For example, a variable can be passed to a procedure by reference, which
takes the address of the parameter and uses the address to modify the
variable’s value, even though it is passed as an IN parameter.  Consider
the following example:

          procedure P is
             Max_Length : constant Natural := 16;
             type Char_Ptr is access all Character;

             procedure Get_String(Buffer: Char_Ptr; Size : Integer);
             pragma Import (C, Get_String, "get_string");

             Name : aliased String (1 .. Max_Length) := (others => ' ');
             Temp : Char_Ptr;

             function Addr (S : String) return Char_Ptr is
                function To_Char_Ptr is
                  new Ada.Unchecked_Conversion (System.Address, Char_Ptr);
             begin
                return To_Char_Ptr (S (S'First)'Address);
             end;

          begin
             Temp := Addr (Name);
             Get_String (Temp, Max_Length);
          end;

where Get_String is a C function that uses the address in Temp to modify
the variable ‘Name’.  This code is dubious, and arguably erroneous, and
the compiler would be entitled to assume that ‘Name’ is never modified,
and generate code accordingly.

However, in practice, this would cause some existing code that seems to
work with no optimization to start failing at high levels of
optimization.

What the compiler does for such cases is to assume that marking a
variable as aliased indicates that some “funny business” may be going
on.  The optimizer recognizes the aliased keyword and inhibits
optimizations that assume the value cannot be assigned.  This means that
the above example will in fact “work” reliably, that is, it will produce
the expected results.

6.3.1.11 Atomic Variables and Optimization
..........................................

There are two considerations with regard to performance when atomic
variables are used.

First, the RM only guarantees that access to atomic variables be atomic,
it has nothing to say about how this is achieved, though there is a
strong implication that this should not be achieved by explicit locking
code.  Indeed GNAT will never generate any locking code for atomic
variable access (it will simply reject any attempt to make a variable or
type atomic if the atomic access cannot be achieved without such locking
code).

That being said, it is important to understand that you cannot assume
that the entire variable will always be accessed.  Consider this
example:

          type R is record
             A,B,C,D : Character;
          end record;
          for R'Size use 32;
          for R'Alignment use 4;

          RV : R;
          pragma Atomic (RV);
          X : Character;
          ...
          X := RV.B;

You cannot assume that the reference to ‘RV.B’ will read the entire
32-bit variable with a single load instruction.  It is perfectly
legitimate if the hardware allows it to do a byte read of just the B
field.  This read is still atomic, which is all the RM requires.  GNAT
can and does take advantage of this, depending on the architecture and
optimization level.  Any assumption to the contrary is non-portable and
risky.  Even if you examine the assembly language and see a full 32-bit
load, this might change in a future version of the compiler.

If your application requires that all accesses to ‘RV’ in this example
be full 32-bit loads, you need to make a copy for the access as in:

          declare
             RV_Copy : constant R := RV;
          begin
             X := RV_Copy.B;
          end;

Now the reference to RV must read the whole variable.  Actually one can
imagine some compiler which figures out that the whole copy is not
required (because only the B field is actually accessed), but GNAT
certainly won’t do that, and we don’t know of any compiler that would
not handle this right, and the above code will in practice work portably
across all architectures (that permit the Atomic declaration).

The second issue with atomic variables has to do with the possible
requirement of generating synchronization code.  For more details on
this, consult the sections on the pragmas
Enable/Disable_Atomic_Synchronization in the GNAT Reference Manual.  If
performance is critical, and such synchronization code is not required,
it may be useful to disable it.

6.3.1.12 Passive Task Optimization
..................................

A passive task is one which is sufficiently simple that in theory a
compiler could recognize it an implement it efficiently without creating
a new thread.  The original design of Ada 83 had in mind this kind of
passive task optimization, but only a few Ada 83 compilers attempted it.
The problem was that it was difficult to determine the exact conditions
under which the optimization was possible.  The result is a very fragile
optimization where a very minor change in the program can suddenly
silently make a task non-optimizable.

With the revisiting of this issue in Ada 95, there was general agreement
that this approach was fundamentally flawed, and the notion of protected
types was introduced.  When using protected types, the restrictions are
well defined, and you KNOW that the operations will be optimized, and
furthermore this optimized performance is fully portable.

Although it would theoretically be possible for GNAT to attempt to do
this optimization, but it really doesn’t make sense in the context of
Ada 95, and none of the Ada 95 compilers implement this optimization as
far as we know.  In particular GNAT never attempts to perform this
optimization.

In any new Ada 95 code that is written, you should always use protected
types in place of tasks that might be able to be optimized in this
manner.  Of course this does not help if you have legacy Ada 83 code
that depends on this optimization, but it is unusual to encounter a case
where the performance gains from this optimization are significant.

Your program should work correctly without this optimization.  If you
have performance problems, then the most practical approach is to figure
out exactly where these performance problems arise, and update those
particular tasks to be protected types.  Note that typically clients of
the tasks who call entries, will not have to be modified, only the task
definition itself.

6.3.2 ‘Text_IO’ Suggestions
---------------------------

The ‘Ada.Text_IO’ package has fairly high overheads due in part to the
requirement of maintaining page and line counts.  If performance is
critical, a recommendation is to use ‘Stream_IO’ instead of ‘Text_IO’
for volume output, since this package has less overhead.

If ‘Text_IO’ must be used, note that by default output to the standard
output and standard error files is unbuffered (this provides better
behavior when output statements are used for debugging, or if the
progress of a program is observed by tracking the output, e.g.  by using
the Unix ‘tail -f’ command to watch redirected output).

If you are generating large volumes of output with ‘Text_IO’ and
performance is an important factor, use a designated file instead of the
standard output file, or change the standard output file to be buffered
using ‘Interfaces.C_Streams.setvbuf’.

6.3.3.1 About unused subprogram/data elimination
................................................

By default, an executable contains all code and data of its composing
objects (directly linked or coming from statically linked libraries),
even data or code never used by this executable.

This feature will allow you to eliminate such unused code from your
executable, making it smaller (in disk and in memory).

This functionality is available on all Linux platforms except for the
IA-64 architecture and on all cross platforms using the ELF binary file
format.  In both cases GNU binutils version 2.16 or later are required
to enable it.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Compilation options,  Next: Example of unused subprogram/data elimination,  Prev: About unused subprogram/data elimination,  Up: Reducing Size of Executables with Unused Subprogram/Data Elimination

6.3.3.2 Compilation options
...........................

The operation of eliminating the unused code and data from the final
executable is directly performed by the linker.

In order to do this, it has to work with objects compiled with the
following options: ‘-ffunction-sections’ ‘-fdata-sections’.

These options are usable with C and Ada files.  They will place
respectively each function or data in a separate section in the
resulting object file.

Once the objects and static libraries are created with these options,
the linker can perform the dead code elimination.  You can do this by
setting the ‘-Wl,--gc-sections’ option to gcc command or in the ‘-largs’
section of ‘gnatmake’.  This will perform a garbage collection of code
and data never referenced.

If the linker performs a partial link (‘-r’ linker option), then you
will need to provide the entry point using the ‘-e’ / ‘--entry’ linker
option.

Note that objects compiled without the ‘-ffunction-sections’ and
‘-fdata-sections’ options can still be linked with the executable.
However, no dead code elimination will be performed on those objects
(they will be linked as is).

The GNAT static library is now compiled with -ffunction-sections and
-fdata-sections on some platforms.  This allows you to eliminate the
unused code and data of the GNAT library from your executable.

6.3.3.3 Example of unused subprogram/data elimination
.....................................................

Here is a simple example:

          with Aux;

          procedure Test is
          begin
             Aux.Used (10);
          end Test;

          package Aux is
             Used_Data   : Integer;
             Unused_Data : Integer;

             procedure Used   (Data : Integer);
             procedure Unused (Data : Integer);
          end Aux;

          package body Aux is
             procedure Used (Data : Integer) is
             begin
                Used_Data := Data;
             end Used;

             procedure Unused (Data : Integer) is
             begin
                Unused_Data := Data;
             end Unused;
          end Aux;

‘Unused’ and ‘Unused_Data’ are never referenced in this code excerpt,
and hence they may be safely removed from the final executable.

          $ gnatmake test

          $ nm test | grep used
          020015f0 T aux__unused
          02005d88 B aux__unused_data
          020015cc T aux__used
          02005d84 B aux__used_data

          $ gnatmake test -cargs -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections \\
               -largs -Wl,--gc-sections

          $ nm test | grep used
          02005350 T aux__used
          0201ffe0 B aux__used_data

It can be observed that the procedure ‘Unused’ and the object
‘Unused_Data’ are removed by the linker when using the appropriate
options.

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Background,  Next: Management of Overflows in GNAT,  Up: Overflow Check Handling in GNAT

6.4.1 Background
----------------

Overflow checks are checks that the compiler may make to ensure that
intermediate results are not out of range.  For example:

          A : Integer;
          ...
          A := A + 1;

If ‘A’ has the value ‘Integer'Last’, then the addition may cause
overflow since the result is out of range of the type ‘Integer’.  In
this case ‘Constraint_Error’ will be raised if checks are enabled.

A trickier situation arises in examples like the following:

          A, C : Integer;
          ...
          A := (A + 1) + C;

where ‘A’ is ‘Integer'Last’ and ‘C’ is ‘-1’.  Now the final result of
the expression on the right hand side is ‘Integer'Last’ which is in
range, but the question arises whether the intermediate addition of ‘(A
+ 1)’ raises an overflow error.

The (perhaps surprising) answer is that the Ada language definition does
not answer this question.  Instead it leaves it up to the implementation
to do one of two things if overflow checks are enabled.

   * raise an exception (‘Constraint_Error’), or

   * yield the correct mathematical result which is then used in
     subsequent operations.

If the compiler chooses the first approach, then the assignment of this
example will indeed raise ‘Constraint_Error’ if overflow checking is
enabled, or result in erroneous execution if overflow checks are
suppressed.

But if the compiler chooses the second approach, then it can perform
both additions yielding the correct mathematical result, which is in
range, so no exception will be raised, and the right result is obtained,
regardless of whether overflow checks are suppressed.

Note that in the first example an exception will be raised in either
case, since if the compiler gives the correct mathematical result for
the addition, it will be out of range of the target type of the
assignment, and thus fails the range check.

This lack of specified behavior in the handling of overflow for
intermediate results is a source of non-portability, and can thus be
problematic when programs are ported.  Most typically this arises in a
situation where the original compiler did not raise an exception, and
then the application is moved to a compiler where the check is performed
on the intermediate result and an unexpected exception is raised.

Furthermore, when using Ada 2012’s preconditions and other assertion
forms, another issue arises.  Consider:

          procedure P (A, B : Integer) with
            Pre => A + B <= Integer'Last;

One often wants to regard arithmetic in a context like this from a
mathematical point of view.  So for example, if the two actual
parameters for a call to ‘P’ are both ‘Integer'Last’, then the
precondition should be regarded as False.  If we are executing in a mode
with run-time checks enabled for preconditions, then we would like this
precondition to fail, rather than raising an exception because of the
intermediate overflow.

However, the language definition leaves the specification of whether the
above condition fails (raising ‘Assert_Error’) or causes an intermediate
overflow (raising ‘Constraint_Error’) up to the implementation.

The situation is worse in a case such as the following:

          procedure Q (A, B, C : Integer) with
            Pre => A + B + C <= Integer'Last;

Consider the call

          Q (A => Integer'Last, B => 1, C => -1);

From a mathematical point of view the precondition is True, but at run
time we may (but are not guaranteed to) get an exception raised because
of the intermediate overflow (and we really would prefer this
precondition to be considered True at run time).

6.4.2 Management of Overflows in GNAT
-------------------------------------

To deal with the portability issue, and with the problem of mathematical
versus run-time interpretation of the expressions in assertions, GNAT
provides comprehensive control over the handling of intermediate
overflow.  GNAT can operate in three modes, and furthermore, permits
separate selection of operating modes for the expressions within
assertions (here the term ‘assertions’ is used in the technical sense,
which includes preconditions and so forth) and for expressions appearing
outside assertions.

The three modes are:

   * ‘Use base type for intermediate operations’ (‘STRICT’)

     In this mode, all intermediate results for predefined arithmetic
     operators are computed using the base type, and the result must be
     in range of the base type.  If this is not the case then either an
     exception is raised (if overflow checks are enabled) or the
     execution is erroneous (if overflow checks are suppressed).  This
     is the normal default mode.

   * ‘Most intermediate overflows avoided’ (‘MINIMIZED’)

     In this mode, the compiler attempts to avoid intermediate overflows
     by using a larger integer type, typically ‘Long_Long_Integer’, as
     the type in which arithmetic is performed for predefined arithmetic
     operators.  This may be slightly more expensive at run time
     (compared to suppressing intermediate overflow checks), though the
     cost is negligible on modern 64-bit machines.  For the examples
     given earlier, no intermediate overflows would have resulted in
     exceptions, since the intermediate results are all in the range of
     ‘Long_Long_Integer’ (typically 64-bits on nearly all
     implementations of GNAT). In addition, if checks are enabled, this
     reduces the number of checks that must be made, so this choice may
     actually result in an improvement in space and time behavior.

     However, there are cases where ‘Long_Long_Integer’ is not large
     enough, consider the following example:

               procedure R (A, B, C, D : Integer) with
                 Pre => (A**2 * B**2) / (C**2 * D**2) <= 10;

     where ‘A’ = ‘B’ = ‘C’ = ‘D’ = ‘Integer'Last’.  Now the intermediate
     results are out of the range of ‘Long_Long_Integer’ even though the
     final result is in range and the precondition is True (from a
     mathematical point of view).  In such a case, operating in this
     mode, an overflow occurs for the intermediate computation (which is
     why this mode says ‘most’ intermediate overflows are avoided).  In
     this case, an exception is raised if overflow checks are enabled,
     and the execution is erroneous if overflow checks are suppressed.

   * ‘All intermediate overflows avoided’ (‘ELIMINATED’)

     In this mode, the compiler avoids all intermediate overflows by
     using arbitrary precision arithmetic as required.  In this mode,
     the above example with ‘A**2 * B**2’ would not cause intermediate
     overflow, because the intermediate result would be evaluated using
     sufficient precision, and the result of evaluating the precondition
     would be True.

     This mode has the advantage of avoiding any intermediate overflows,
     but at the expense of significant run-time overhead, including the
     use of a library (included automatically in this mode) for
     multiple-precision arithmetic.

     This mode provides cleaner semantics for assertions, since now the
     run-time behavior emulates true arithmetic behavior for the
     predefined arithmetic operators, meaning that there is never a
     conflict between the mathematical view of the assertion, and its
     run-time behavior.

     Note that in this mode, the behavior is unaffected by whether or
     not overflow checks are suppressed, since overflow does not occur.
     It is possible for gigantic intermediate expressions to raise
     ‘Storage_Error’ as a result of attempting to compute the results of
     such expressions (e.g.  ‘Integer'Last ** Integer'Last’) but
     overflow is impossible.

Note that these modes apply only to the evaluation of predefined
arithmetic, membership, and comparison operators for signed integer
arithmetic.

For fixed-point arithmetic, checks can be suppressed.  But if checks are
enabled then fixed-point values are always checked for overflow against
the base type for intermediate expressions (that is such checks always
operate in the equivalent of ‘STRICT’ mode).

For floating-point, on nearly all architectures, ‘Machine_Overflows’ is
False, and IEEE infinities are generated, so overflow exceptions are
never raised.  If you want to avoid infinities, and check that final
results of expressions are in range, then you can declare a constrained
floating-point type, and range checks will be carried out in the normal
manner (with infinite values always failing all range checks).


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Specifying the Desired Mode,  Next: Default Settings,  Prev: Management of Overflows in GNAT,  Up: Overflow Check Handling in GNAT

6.4.3 Specifying the Desired Mode
---------------------------------

The desired mode of for handling intermediate overflow can be specified
using either the ‘Overflow_Mode’ pragma or an equivalent compiler
switch.  The pragma has the form

          pragma Overflow_Mode ([General =>] MODE [, [Assertions =>] MODE]);

where ‘MODE’ is one of

   * ‘STRICT’: intermediate overflows checked (using base type)

   * ‘MINIMIZED’: minimize intermediate overflows

   * ‘ELIMINATED’: eliminate intermediate overflows

The case is ignored, so ‘MINIMIZED’, ‘Minimized’ and ‘minimized’ all
have the same effect.

If only the ‘General’ parameter is present, then the given ‘MODE’
applies to expressions both within and outside assertions.  If both
arguments are present, then ‘General’ applies to expressions outside
assertions, and ‘Assertions’ applies to expressions within assertions.
For example:

          pragma Overflow_Mode
            (General => Minimized, Assertions => Eliminated);

specifies that general expressions outside assertions be evaluated in
‘minimize intermediate overflows’ mode, and expressions within
assertions be evaluated in ‘eliminate intermediate overflows’ mode.
This is often a reasonable choice, avoiding excessive overhead outside
assertions, but assuring a high degree of portability when importing
code from another compiler, while incurring the extra overhead for
assertion expressions to ensure that the behavior at run time matches
the expected mathematical behavior.

The ‘Overflow_Mode’ pragma has the same scoping and placement rules as
pragma ‘Suppress’, so it can occur either as a configuration pragma,
specifying a default for the whole program, or in a declarative scope,
where it applies to the remaining declarations and statements in that
scope.

Note that pragma ‘Overflow_Mode’ does not affect whether overflow checks
are enabled or suppressed.  It only controls the method used to compute
intermediate values.  To control whether overflow checking is enabled or
suppressed, use pragma ‘Suppress’ or ‘Unsuppress’ in the usual manner.

Additionally, a compiler switch ‘-gnato?’ or ‘-gnato??’ can be used to
control the checking mode default (which can be subsequently overridden
using pragmas).

Here ‘?’ is one of the digits ‘1’ through ‘3’:

     ‘1’        use base type for intermediate operations (‘STRICT’)
                
                
     ‘2’        minimize intermediate overflows (‘MINIMIZED’)
                
                
     ‘3’        eliminate intermediate overflows (‘ELIMINATED’)
                

As with the pragma, if only one digit appears then it applies to all
cases; if two digits are given, then the first applies outside
assertions, and the second within assertions.  Thus the equivalent of
the example pragma above would be ‘-gnato23’.

If no digits follow the ‘-gnato’, then it is equivalent to ‘-gnato11’,
causing all intermediate operations to be computed using the base type
(‘STRICT’ mode).

6.4.4 Default Settings
----------------------

The default mode for overflow checks is

          General => Strict

which causes all computations both inside and outside assertions to use
the base type, and is equivalent to ‘-gnato’ (with no digits following).

The pragma ‘Suppress (Overflow_Check)’ disables overflow checking, but
it has no effect on the method used for computing intermediate results.

The pragma ‘Unsuppress (Overflow_Check)’ enables overflow checking, but
it has no effect on the method used for computing intermediate results.

6.4.5 Implementation Notes
--------------------------

In practice on typical 64-bit machines, the ‘MINIMIZED’ mode is
reasonably efficient, and can be generally used.  It also helps to
ensure compatibility with code imported from some other compiler to
GNAT.

Setting all intermediate overflows checking (‘STRICT’ mode) makes sense
if you want to make sure that your code is compatible with any other
possible Ada implementation.  This may be useful in ensuring portability
for code that is to be exported to some other compiler than GNAT.

The Ada standard allows the reassociation of expressions at the same
precedence level if no parentheses are present.  For example, ‘A+B+C’
parses as though it were ‘(A+B)+C’, but the compiler can reintepret this
as ‘A+(B+C)’, possibly introducing or eliminating an overflow exception.
The GNAT compiler never takes advantage of this freedom, and the
expression ‘A+B+C’ will be evaluated as ‘(A+B)+C’.  If you need the
other order, you can write the parentheses explicitly ‘A+(B+C)’ and GNAT
will respect this order.

The use of ‘ELIMINATED’ mode will cause the compiler to automatically
include an appropriate arbitrary precision integer arithmetic package.
The compiler will make calls to this package, though only in cases where
it cannot be sure that ‘Long_Long_Integer’ is sufficient to guard
against intermediate overflows.  This package does not use dynamic
allocation, but it does use the secondary stack, so an appropriate
secondary stack package must be present (this is always true for
standard full Ada, but may require specific steps for restricted run
times such as ZFP).

Although ‘ELIMINATED’ mode causes expressions to use arbitrary precision
arithmetic, avoiding overflow, the final result must be in an
appropriate range.  This is true even if the final result is of type
‘[Long_[Long_]]Integer'Base’, which still has the same bounds as its
associated constrained type at run-time.

Currently, the ‘ELIMINATED’ mode is only available on target platforms
for which ‘Long_Long_Integer’ is 64-bits (nearly all GNAT platforms).

6.5 Performing Dimensionality Analysis in GNAT
==============================================

The GNAT compiler supports dimensionality checking.  The user can
specify physical units for objects, and the compiler will verify that
uses of these objects are compatible with their dimensions, in a fashion
that is familiar to engineering practice.  The dimensions of algebraic
expressions (including powers with static exponents) are computed from
their constituents.

This feature depends on Ada 2012 aspect specifications, and is available
from version 7.0.1 of GNAT onwards.  The GNAT-specific aspect
‘Dimension_System’ allows you to define a system of units; the aspect
‘Dimension’ then allows the user to declare dimensioned quantities
within a given system.  (These aspects are described in the
‘Implementation Defined Aspects’ chapter of the ‘GNAT Reference
Manual’).

The major advantage of this model is that it does not require the
declaration of multiple operators for all possible combinations of
types: it is only necessary to use the proper subtypes in object
declarations.

The simplest way to impose dimensionality checking on a computation is
to make use of one of the instantiations of the package
‘System.Dim.Generic_Mks’, which are part of the GNAT library.  This
generic package defines a floating-point type ‘MKS_Type’, for which a
sequence of dimension names are specified, together with their
conventional abbreviations.  The following should be read together with
the full specification of the package, in file ‘s-digemk.ads’.

          type Mks_Type is new Float_Type
            with
             Dimension_System => (
               (Unit_Name => Meter,    Unit_Symbol => 'm',   Dim_Symbol => 'L'),
               (Unit_Name => Kilogram, Unit_Symbol => "kg",  Dim_Symbol => 'M'),
               (Unit_Name => Second,   Unit_Symbol => 's',   Dim_Symbol => 'T'),
               (Unit_Name => Ampere,   Unit_Symbol => 'A',   Dim_Symbol => 'I'),
               (Unit_Name => Kelvin,   Unit_Symbol => 'K',   Dim_Symbol => "Theta"),
               (Unit_Name => Mole,     Unit_Symbol => "mol", Dim_Symbol => 'N'),
               (Unit_Name => Candela,  Unit_Symbol => "cd",  Dim_Symbol => 'J'));

The package then defines a series of subtypes that correspond to these
conventional units.  For example:

          subtype Length is Mks_Type
            with
             Dimension => (Symbol => 'm', Meter  => 1, others => 0);

and similarly for ‘Mass’, ‘Time’, ‘Electric_Current’,
‘Thermodynamic_Temperature’, ‘Amount_Of_Substance’, and
‘Luminous_Intensity’ (the standard set of units of the SI system).

The package also defines conventional names for values of each unit, for
example:

          m   : constant Length           := 1.0;
          kg  : constant Mass             := 1.0;
          s   : constant Time             := 1.0;
          A   : constant Electric_Current := 1.0;

as well as useful multiples of these units:

           cm  : constant Length := 1.0E-02;
           g   : constant Mass   := 1.0E-03;
           min : constant Time   := 60.0;
           day : constant Time   := 60.0 * 24.0 * min;
          ...

There are three instantiations of ‘System.Dim.Generic_Mks’ defined in
the GNAT library:

   * ‘System.Dim.Float_Mks’ based on ‘Float’ defined in ‘s-diflmk.ads’.

   * ‘System.Dim.Long_Mks’ based on ‘Long_Float’ defined in
     ‘s-dilomk.ads’.

   * ‘System.Dim.Mks’ based on ‘Long_Long_Float’ defined in
     ‘s-dimmks.ads’.

Using one of these packages, you can then define a derived unit by
providing the aspect that specifies its dimensions within the MKS
system, as well as the string to be used for output of a value of that
unit:

          subtype Acceleration is Mks_Type
            with Dimension => ("m/sec^2",
                               Meter => 1,
                               Second => -2,
                               others => 0);

Here is a complete example of use:

          with System.Dim.MKS; use System.Dim.Mks;
          with System.Dim.Mks_IO; use System.Dim.Mks_IO;
          with Text_IO; use Text_IO;
          procedure Free_Fall is
            subtype Acceleration is Mks_Type
              with Dimension => ("m/sec^2", 1, 0, -2, others => 0);
            G : constant acceleration := 9.81 * m / (s ** 2);
            T : Time := 10.0*s;
            Distance : Length;

          begin
            Put ("Gravitational constant: ");
            Put (G, Aft => 2, Exp => 0); Put_Line ("");
            Distance := 0.5 * G * T ** 2;
            Put ("distance travelled in 10 seconds of free fall ");
            Put (Distance, Aft => 2, Exp => 0);
            Put_Line ("");
          end Free_Fall;

Execution of this program yields:

          Gravitational constant:  9.81 m/sec^2
          distance travelled in 10 seconds of free fall 490.50 m

However, incorrect assignments such as:

          Distance := 5.0;
          Distance := 5.0 * kg;

are rejected with the following diagnoses:

          Distance := 5.0;
             >>> dimensions mismatch in assignment
             >>> left-hand side has dimension [L]
             >>> right-hand side is dimensionless

          Distance := 5.0 * kg:
             >>> dimensions mismatch in assignment
             >>> left-hand side has dimension [L]
             >>> right-hand side has dimension [M]

The dimensions of an expression are properly displayed, even if there is
no explicit subtype for it.  If we add to the program:

          Put ("Final velocity: ");
          Put (G * T, Aft =>2, Exp =>0);
          Put_Line ("");

then the output includes:

          Final velocity: 98.10 m.s**(-1)

The type ‘Mks_Type’ is said to be a ‘dimensionable type’ since it has a
‘Dimension_System’ aspect, and the subtypes ‘Length’, ‘Mass’, etc., are
said to be ‘dimensioned subtypes’ since each one has a ‘Dimension’
aspect.

The ‘Dimension’ aspect of a dimensioned subtype ‘S’ defines a mapping
from the base type’s Unit_Names to integer (or, more generally,
rational) values.  This mapping is the ‘dimension vector’ (also referred
to as the ‘dimensionality’) for that subtype, denoted by ‘DV(S)’, and
thus for each object of that subtype.  Intuitively, the value specified
for each ‘Unit_Name’ is the exponent associated with that unit; a zero
value means that the unit is not used.  For example:

          declare
             Acc : Acceleration;
             ...
          begin
             ...
          end;

Here ‘DV(Acc)’ = ‘DV(Acceleration)’ = ‘(Meter=>1, Kilogram=>0,
Second=>-2, Ampere=>0, Kelvin=>0, Mole=>0, Candela=>0)’.  Symbolically,
we can express this as ‘Meter / Second**2’.

The dimension vector of an arithmetic expression is synthesized from the
dimension vectors of its components, with compile-time dimensionality
checks that help prevent mismatches such as using an ‘Acceleration’
where a ‘Length’ is required.

The dimension vector of the result of an arithmetic expression ‘expr’,
or ‘DV(EXPR)’, is defined as follows, assuming conventional mathematical
definitions for the vector operations that are used:

   * If ‘expr’ is of the type ‘universal_real’, or is not of a
     dimensioned subtype, then ‘expr’ is dimensionless; ‘DV(EXPR)’ is
     the empty vector.

   * ‘DV(OP EXPR)’, where ‘op’ is a unary operator, is ‘DV(EXPR)’

   * ‘DV(EXPR1 OP EXPR2)’ where ‘op’ is “+” or “-” is ‘DV(EXPR1)’
     provided that ‘DV(EXPR1)’ = ‘DV(EXPR2)’.  If this condition is not
     met then the construct is illegal.

   * ‘DV(EXPR1 * EXPR2)’ is ‘DV(EXPR1)’ + ‘DV(EXPR2)’, and ‘DV(EXPR1 /
     EXPR2)’ = ‘DV(EXPR1)’ - ‘DV(EXPR2)’.  In this context if one of the
     ‘expr’s is dimensionless then its empty dimension vector is treated
     as ‘(others => 0)’.

   * ‘DV(EXPR ** POWER)’ is ‘power’ * ‘DV(EXPR)’, provided that ‘power’
     is a static rational value.  If this condition is not met then the
     construct is illegal.

Note that, by the above rules, it is illegal to use binary “+” or “-” to
combine a dimensioned and dimensionless value.  Thus an expression such
as ‘acc-10.0’ is illegal, where ‘acc’ is an object of subtype
‘Acceleration’.

The dimensionality checks for relationals use the same rules as for “+”
and “-”, except when comparing to a literal; thus

          acc > len

is equivalent to

          acc-len > 0.0

and is thus illegal, but

          acc > 10.0

is accepted with a warning.  Analogously a conditional expression
requires the same dimension vector for each branch (with no exception
for literals).

The dimension vector of a type conversion ‘T(EXPR)’ is defined as
follows, based on the nature of ‘T’:

   * If ‘T’ is a dimensioned subtype then ‘DV(T(EXPR))’ is ‘DV(T)’
     provided that either ‘expr’ is dimensionless or ‘DV(T)’ =
     ‘DV(EXPR)’.  The conversion is illegal if ‘expr’ is dimensioned and
     ‘DV(EXPR)’ /= ‘DV(T)’.  Note that vector equality does not require
     that the corresponding Unit_Names be the same.

     As a consequence of the above rule, it is possible to convert
     between different dimension systems that follow the same
     international system of units, with the seven physical components
     given in the standard order (length, mass, time, etc.).  Thus a
     length in meters can be converted to a length in inches (with a
     suitable conversion factor) but cannot be converted, for example,
     to a mass in pounds.

   * If ‘T’ is the base type for ‘expr’ (and the dimensionless root type
     of the dimension system), then ‘DV(T(EXPR))’ is ‘DV(expr)’.  Thus,
     if ‘expr’ is of a dimensioned subtype of ‘T’, the conversion may be
     regarded as a “view conversion” that preserves dimensionality.

     This rule makes it possible to write generic code that can be
     instantiated with compatible dimensioned subtypes.  The generic
     unit will contain conversions that will consequently be present in
     instantiations, but conversions to the base type will preserve
     dimensionality and make it possible to write generic code that is
     correct with respect to dimensionality.

   * Otherwise (i.e., ‘T’ is neither a dimensioned subtype nor a
     dimensionable base type), ‘DV(T(EXPR))’ is the empty vector.  Thus
     a dimensioned value can be explicitly converted to a
     non-dimensioned subtype, which of course then escapes
     dimensionality analysis.

The dimension vector for a type qualification ‘T'(EXPR)’ is the same as
for the type conversion ‘T(EXPR)’.

An assignment statement

          Source := Target;

requires ‘DV(Source)’ = ‘DV(Target)’, and analogously for parameter
passing (the dimension vector for the actual parameter must be equal to
the dimension vector for the formal parameter).

When using dimensioned types with elementary functions it is necessary
to instantiate the ‘Ada.Numerics.Generic_Elementary_Functions’ package
using the ‘Mks_Type’ and not any of the derived subtypes such as
‘Distance’.  For functions such as ‘Sqrt’ the dimensional analysis will
fail when using the subtypes because both the parameter and return are
of the same type.

An example instantiation

          package Mks_Numerics is new
             Ada.Numerics.Generic_Elementary_Functions (System.Dim.Mks.Mks_Type);

6.6 Stack Related Facilities
============================

This section describes some useful tools associated with stack checking
and analysis.  In particular, it deals with dynamic and static stack
usage measurements.

* Menu:

* Stack Overflow Checking::
* Static Stack Usage Analysis::
* Dynamic Stack Usage Analysis::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Stack Overflow Checking,  Next: Static Stack Usage Analysis,  Up: Stack Related Facilities

6.6.1 Stack Overflow Checking
-----------------------------

For most operating systems, ‘gcc’ does not perform stack overflow
checking by default.  This means that if the main environment task or
some other task exceeds the available stack space, then unpredictable
behavior will occur.  Most native systems offer some level of protection
by adding a guard page at the end of each task stack.  This mechanism is
usually not enough for dealing properly with stack overflow situations
because a large local variable could “jump” above the guard page.
Furthermore, when the guard page is hit, there may not be any space left
on the stack for executing the exception propagation code.  Enabling
stack checking avoids such situations.

To activate stack checking, compile all units with the ‘gcc’ option
‘-fstack-check’.  For example:

          $ gcc -c -fstack-check package1.adb

Units compiled with this option will generate extra instructions to
check that any use of the stack (for procedure calls or for declaring
local variables in declare blocks) does not exceed the available stack
space.  If the space is exceeded, then a ‘Storage_Error’ exception is
raised.

For declared tasks, the default stack size is defined by the GNAT
runtime, whose size may be modified at bind time through the ‘-d’ bind
switch (*note Switches for gnatbind: 112.).  Task specific stack sizes
may be set using the ‘Storage_Size’ pragma.

For the environment task, the stack size is determined by the operating
system.  Consequently, to modify the size of the environment task please
refer to your operating system documentation.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Static Stack Usage Analysis,  Next: Dynamic Stack Usage Analysis,  Prev: Stack Overflow Checking,  Up: Stack Related Facilities

6.6.2 Static Stack Usage Analysis
---------------------------------

A unit compiled with ‘-fstack-usage’ will generate an extra file that
specifies the maximum amount of stack used, on a per-function basis.
The file has the same basename as the target object file with a ‘.su’
extension.  Each line of this file is made up of three fields:

   * The name of the function.

   * A number of bytes.

   * One or more qualifiers: ‘static’, ‘dynamic’, ‘bounded’.

The second field corresponds to the size of the known part of the
function frame.

The qualifier ‘static’ means that the function frame size is purely
static.  It usually means that all local variables have a static size.
In this case, the second field is a reliable measure of the function
stack utilization.

The qualifier ‘dynamic’ means that the function frame size is not
static.  It happens mainly when some local variables have a dynamic
size.  When this qualifier appears alone, the second field is not a
reliable measure of the function stack analysis.  When it is qualified
with ‘bounded’, it means that the second field is a reliable maximum of
the function stack utilization.

A unit compiled with ‘-Wstack-usage’ will issue a warning for each
subprogram whose stack usage might be larger than the specified amount
of bytes.  The wording is in keeping with the qualifier documented
above.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Dynamic Stack Usage Analysis,  Prev: Static Stack Usage Analysis,  Up: Stack Related Facilities

6.6.3 Dynamic Stack Usage Analysis
----------------------------------

It is possible to measure the maximum amount of stack used by a task, by
adding a switch to ‘gnatbind’, as:

          $ gnatbind -u0 file

With this option, at each task termination, its stack usage is output on
‘stderr’.  Note that this switch is not compatible with tools like
Valgrind and DrMemory; they will report errors.

It is not always convenient to output the stack usage when the program
is still running.  Hence, it is possible to delay this output until
program termination.  for a given number of tasks specified as the
argument of the ‘-u’ option.  For instance:

          $ gnatbind -u100 file

will buffer the stack usage information of the first 100 tasks to
terminate and output this info at program termination.  Results are
displayed in four columns:

          Index | Task Name | Stack Size | Stack Usage

where:

   * ‘Index’ is a number associated with each task.

   * ‘Task Name’ is the name of the task analyzed.

   * ‘Stack Size’ is the maximum size for the stack.

   * ‘Stack Usage’ is the measure done by the stack analyzer.  In order
     to prevent overflow, the stack is not entirely analyzed, and it’s
     not possible to know exactly how much has actually been used.

By default the environment task stack, the stack that contains the main
unit, is not processed.  To enable processing of the environment task
stack, the environment variable GNAT_STACK_LIMIT needs to be set to the
maximum size of the environment task stack.  This amount is given in
kilobytes.  For example:

          $ set GNAT_STACK_LIMIT 1600

would specify to the analyzer that the environment task stack has a
limit of 1.6 megabytes.  Any stack usage beyond this will be ignored by
the analysis.

The package ‘GNAT.Task_Stack_Usage’ provides facilities to get
stack-usage reports at run time.  See its body for the details.

6.7 Memory Management Issues
============================

This section describes some useful memory pools provided in the GNAT
library and in particular the GNAT Debug Pool facility, which can be
used to detect incorrect uses of access values (including ‘dangling
references’).

* Menu:

* Some Useful Memory Pools::
* The GNAT Debug Pool Facility::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Some Useful Memory Pools,  Next: The GNAT Debug Pool Facility,  Up: Memory Management Issues

6.7.1 Some Useful Memory Pools
------------------------------

The ‘System.Pool_Global’ package offers the Unbounded_No_Reclaim_Pool
storage pool.  Allocations use the standard system call ‘malloc’ while
deallocations use the standard system call ‘free’.  No reclamation is
performed when the pool goes out of scope.  For performance reasons, the
standard default Ada allocators/deallocators do not use any explicit
storage pools but if they did, they could use this storage pool without
any change in behavior.  That is why this storage pool is used when the
user manages to make the default implicit allocator explicit as in this
example:

          type T1 is access Something;
           -- no Storage pool is defined for T2

          type T2 is access Something_Else;
          for T2'Storage_Pool use T1'Storage_Pool;
          -- the above is equivalent to
          for T2'Storage_Pool use System.Pool_Global.Global_Pool_Object;

The ‘System.Pool_Local’ package offers the ‘Unbounded_Reclaim_Pool’
storage pool.  The allocation strategy is similar to ‘Pool_Local’ except
that the all storage allocated with this pool is reclaimed when the pool
object goes out of scope.  This pool provides a explicit mechanism
similar to the implicit one provided by several Ada 83 compilers for
allocations performed through a local access type and whose purpose was
to reclaim memory when exiting the scope of a given local access.  As an
example, the following program does not leak memory even though it does
not perform explicit deallocation:

          with System.Pool_Local;
          procedure Pooloc1 is
             procedure Internal is
                type A is access Integer;
                X : System.Pool_Local.Unbounded_Reclaim_Pool;
                for A'Storage_Pool use X;
                v : A;
             begin
                for I in 1 .. 50 loop
                   v := new Integer;
                end loop;
             end Internal;
          begin
             for I in 1 .. 100 loop
                Internal;
             end loop;
          end Pooloc1;

The ‘System.Pool_Size’ package implements the ‘Stack_Bounded_Pool’ used
when ‘Storage_Size’ is specified for an access type.  The whole storage
for the pool is allocated at once, usually on the stack at the point
where the access type is elaborated.  It is automatically reclaimed when
exiting the scope where the access type is defined.  This package is not
intended to be used directly by the user and it is implicitly used for
each such declaration:

          type T1 is access Something;
          for T1'Storage_Size use 10_000;


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: The GNAT Debug Pool Facility,  Prev: Some Useful Memory Pools,  Up: Memory Management Issues

6.7.2 The GNAT Debug Pool Facility
----------------------------------

The use of unchecked deallocation and unchecked conversion can easily
lead to incorrect memory references.  The problems generated by such
references are usually difficult to tackle because the symptoms can be
very remote from the origin of the problem.  In such cases, it is very
helpful to detect the problem as early as possible.  This is the purpose
of the Storage Pool provided by ‘GNAT.Debug_Pools’.

In order to use the GNAT specific debugging pool, the user must
associate a debug pool object with each of the access types that may be
related to suspected memory problems.  See Ada Reference Manual 13.11.

          type Ptr is access Some_Type;
          Pool : GNAT.Debug_Pools.Debug_Pool;
          for Ptr'Storage_Pool use Pool;

‘GNAT.Debug_Pools’ is derived from a GNAT-specific kind of pool: the
‘Checked_Pool’.  Such pools, like standard Ada storage pools, allow the
user to redefine allocation and deallocation strategies.  They also
provide a checkpoint for each dereference, through the use of the
primitive operation ‘Dereference’ which is implicitly called at each
dereference of an access value.

Once an access type has been associated with a debug pool, operations on
values of the type may raise four distinct exceptions, which correspond
to four potential kinds of memory corruption:

   * ‘GNAT.Debug_Pools.Accessing_Not_Allocated_Storage’

   * ‘GNAT.Debug_Pools.Accessing_Deallocated_Storage’

   * ‘GNAT.Debug_Pools.Freeing_Not_Allocated_Storage’

   * ‘GNAT.Debug_Pools.Freeing_Deallocated_Storage’

For types associated with a Debug_Pool, dynamic allocation is performed
using the standard GNAT allocation routine.  References to all allocated
chunks of memory are kept in an internal dictionary.  Several
deallocation strategies are provided, whereupon the user can choose to
release the memory to the system, keep it allocated for further invalid
access checks, or fill it with an easily recognizable pattern for debug
sessions.  The memory pattern is the old IBM hexadecimal convention:
‘16#DEADBEEF#’.

See the documentation in the file g-debpoo.ads for more information on
the various strategies.

Upon each dereference, a check is made that the access value denotes a
properly allocated memory location.  Here is a complete example of use
of ‘Debug_Pools’, that includes typical instances of memory corruption:

          with GNAT.IO; use GNAT.IO;
          with Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation;
          with Ada.Unchecked_Conversion;
          with GNAT.Debug_Pools;
          with System.Storage_Elements;
          with Ada.Exceptions; use Ada.Exceptions;
          procedure Debug_Pool_Test is

             type T is access Integer;
             type U is access all T;

             P : GNAT.Debug_Pools.Debug_Pool;
             for T'Storage_Pool use P;

             procedure Free is new Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation (Integer, T);
             function UC is new Ada.Unchecked_Conversion (U, T);
             A, B : aliased T;

             procedure Info is new GNAT.Debug_Pools.Print_Info(Put_Line);

          begin
             Info (P);
             A := new Integer;
             B := new Integer;
             B := A;
             Info (P);
             Free (A);
             begin
                Put_Line (Integer'Image(B.all));
             exception
                when E : others => Put_Line ("raised: " & Exception_Name (E));
             end;
             begin
                Free (B);
             exception
                when E : others => Put_Line ("raised: " & Exception_Name (E));
             end;
             B := UC(A'Access);
             begin
                Put_Line (Integer'Image(B.all));
             exception
                when E : others => Put_Line ("raised: " & Exception_Name (E));
             end;
             begin
                Free (B);
             exception
                when E : others => Put_Line ("raised: " & Exception_Name (E));
             end;
             Info (P);
          end Debug_Pool_Test;

The debug pool mechanism provides the following precise diagnostics on
the execution of this erroneous program:

          Debug Pool info:
            Total allocated bytes :  0
            Total deallocated bytes :  0

7.1 Run-Time Libraries
======================

The GNAT run-time implementation may vary with respect to both the
underlying threads library and the exception-handling scheme.  For
threads support, the default run-time will bind to the thread package of
the underlying operating system.

For exception handling, either or both of two models are supplied:

   * ‘Zero-Cost Exceptions’ (“ZCX”), which uses binder-generated tables
     that are interrogated at run time to locate a handler.

   * ‘setjmp / longjmp’ (‘SJLJ’), which uses dynamically-set data to
     establish the set of handlers

Most programs should experience a substantial speed improvement by being
compiled with a ZCX run-time.  This is especially true for tasking
applications or applications with many exception handlers.  Note however
that the ZCX run-time does not support asynchronous abort of tasks
(‘abort’ and ‘select-then-abort’ constructs) and will instead implement
abort by polling points in the runtime.  You can also add additional
polling points explicitly if needed in your application via ‘pragma
Abort_Defer’.

This section summarizes which combinations of threads and exception
support are supplied on various GNAT platforms.

7.2 Specifying a Run-Time Library
=================================

The ‘adainclude’ subdirectory containing the sources of the GNAT
run-time library, and the ‘adalib’ subdirectory containing the ‘ALI’
files and the static and/or shared GNAT library, are located in the gcc
target-dependent area:

          target=$prefix/lib/gcc/gcc-*dumpmachine*/gcc-*dumpversion*/

As indicated above, on some platforms several run-time libraries are
supplied.  These libraries are installed in the target dependent area
and contain a complete source and binary subdirectory.  The detailed
description below explains the differences between the different
libraries in terms of their thread support.

The default run-time library (when GNAT is installed) is ‘rts-native’.
This default run-time is selected by the means of soft links.  For
example on x86-linux:

                    $(target-dir)
                   __/ /      \ \___
           _______/   /        \    \_________________
          /          /          \                     \
         /          /            \                     \
     ADAINCLUDE  ADALIB      rts-native             rts-sjlj
        :          :            /    \                 /   \
        :          :           /      \               /     \
        :          :          /        \             /       \
        :          :         /          \           /         \
        +-------------> adainclude     adalib   adainclude   adalib
                   :                     ^
                   :                     :
                   +---------------------+

                   Run-Time Library Directory Structure
        (Upper-case names and dotted/dashed arrows represent soft links)

If the ‘rts-sjlj’ library is to be selected on a permanent basis, these
soft links can be modified with the following commands:

          $ cd $target
          $ rm -f adainclude adalib
          $ ln -s rts-sjlj/adainclude adainclude
          $ ln -s rts-sjlj/adalib adalib

Alternatively, you can specify ‘rts-sjlj/adainclude’ in the file
‘$target/ada_source_path’ and ‘rts-sjlj/adalib’ in
‘$target/ada_object_path’.

Selecting another run-time library temporarily can be achieved by using
the ‘--RTS’ switch, e.g., ‘--RTS=sjlj’

* Choosing the Scheduling Policy::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Choosing the Scheduling Policy,  Up: Specifying a Run-Time Library

7.2.1 Choosing the Scheduling Policy
------------------------------------

When using a POSIX threads implementation, you have a choice of several
scheduling policies: ‘SCHED_FIFO’, ‘SCHED_RR’ and ‘SCHED_OTHER’.

Typically, the default is ‘SCHED_OTHER’, while using ‘SCHED_FIFO’ or
‘SCHED_RR’ requires special (e.g., root) privileges.

By default, GNAT uses the ‘SCHED_OTHER’ policy.  To specify
‘SCHED_FIFO’, you can use one of the following:

   * ‘pragma Time_Slice (0.0)’

   * the corresponding binder option ‘-T0’

   * ‘pragma Task_Dispatching_Policy (FIFO_Within_Priorities)’

To specify ‘SCHED_RR’, you should use ‘pragma Time_Slice’ with a value
greater than 0.0, or else use the corresponding ‘-T’ binder option.

To make sure a program is running as root, you can put something like
this in a library package body in your application:

          function geteuid return Integer;
          pragma Import (C, geteuid, "geteuid");
          Ignore : constant Boolean :=
            (if geteuid = 0 then True else raise Program_Error with "must be root");

It gets the effective user id, and if it’s not 0 (i.e.  root), it raises
Program_Error.  Note that if you re running the code in a container,
this may not be sufficient, as you may have sufficient priviledge on the
container, but not on the host machine running the container, so check
that you also have sufficient priviledge for running the container
image.

7.3.1 Required Packages on GNU/Linux
------------------------------------

GNAT requires the C library developer’s package to be installed.  The
name of of that package depends on your GNU/Linux distribution:

   * RedHat, SUSE: ‘glibc-devel’;

   * Debian, Ubuntu: ‘libc6-dev’ (normally installed by default).

If using the 32-bit version of GNAT on a 64-bit version of GNU/Linux,
you’ll need the 32-bit version of the following packages:

   * RedHat, SUSE: ‘glibc.i686’, ‘glibc-devel.i686’, ‘ncurses-libs.i686’

   * SUSE: ‘glibc-locale-base-32bit’

   * Debian, Ubuntu: ‘libc6:i386’, ‘libc6-dev:i386’, ‘lib32ncursesw5’

Other GNU/Linux distributions might be choosing a different name for
those packages.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Position Independent Executable PIE Enabled by Default on Linux,  Next: A GNU/Linux Debug Quirk,  Prev: Required Packages on GNU/Linux,  Up: GNU/Linux Topics

7.3.2 Position Independent Executable (PIE) Enabled by Default on Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

GNAT generates Position Independent Executable (PIE) code by default.
PIE binaries are loaded into random memory locations, introducing an
additional layer of protection against attacks.

Building PIE binaries requires that all of their dependencies also be
built as Position Independent.  If the link of your project fails with
an error like:

     /[...]/ld: /path/to/object/file: relocation R_X86_64_32S against symbol
     `symbol name' can not be used when making a PIE object;
     recompile with -fPIE

it means the identified object file has not been built as Position
Independent.

If you are not interested in building PIE binaries, you can simply turn
this feature off by first compiling your code with ‘-fno-pie’ and then
by linking with ‘-no-pie’ (note the subtle but important difference in
the names of the options – the linker option does ‘not’ have an ‘f’
after the dash!).  When using gprbuild, this is achieved by updating the
‘Required_Switches’ attribute in package ‘Compiler’ and, depending on
your type of project, either attribute ‘Switches’ or attribute
‘Library_Options’ in package ‘Linker’.

On the other hand, if you would like to build PIE binaries and you are
getting the error above, a quick and easy workaround to allow linking to
succeed again is to disable PIE during the link, thus temporarily
lifting the requirement that all dependencies also be Position
Independent code.  To do so, you simply need to add ‘-no-pie’ to the
list of switches passed to the linker.  As part of this workaround,
there is no need to adjust the compiler switches.

From there, to be able to link your binaries with PIE and therefore drop
the ‘-no-pie’ workaround, you’ll need to get the identified dependencies
rebuilt with PIE enabled (compiled with ‘-fPIE’ and linked with ‘-pie’).

7.3.3 A GNU/Linux Debug Quirk
-----------------------------

On SuSE 15, some kernels have a defect causing issues when debugging
programs using threads or Ada tasks.  Due to the lack of documentation
found regarding this kernel issue, we can only provide limited
information about which kernels are impacted: kernel version 5.3.18 is
known to be impacted, and kernels in the 5.14 range or newer are
believed to fix this problem.

The bug affects the debugging of 32-bit processes on a 64-bit system.
Symptoms can vary: Unexpected ‘SIGABRT’ signals being received by the
program, “The futex facility returned an unexpected error code” error
message, and inferior programs hanging indefinitely range among the
symptoms most commonly observed.

7.4.1 Using GNAT on Windows
---------------------------

One of the strengths of the GNAT technology is that its tool set (‘gcc’,
‘gnatbind’, ‘gnatlink’, ‘gnatmake’, the ‘gdb’ debugger, etc.)  is used
in the same way regardless of the platform.

On Windows this tool set is complemented by a number of
Microsoft-specific tools that have been provided to facilitate
interoperability with Windows when this is required.  With these tools:

   * You can build applications using the ‘CONSOLE’ or ‘WINDOWS’
     subsystems.

   * You can use any Dynamically Linked Library (DLL) in your Ada code
     (both relocatable and non-relocatable DLLs are supported).

   * You can build Ada DLLs for use in other applications.  These
     applications can be written in a language other than Ada (e.g., C,
     C++, etc).  Again both relocatable and non-relocatable Ada DLLs are
     supported.

   * You can include Windows resources in your Ada application.

   * You can use or create COM/DCOM objects.

Immediately below are listed all known general GNAT-for-Windows
restrictions.  Other restrictions about specific features like Windows
Resources and DLLs are listed in separate sections below.

   * It is not possible to use ‘GetLastError’ and ‘SetLastError’ when
     tasking, protected records, or exceptions are used.  In these
     cases, in order to implement Ada semantics, the GNAT run-time
     system calls certain Win32 routines that set the last error
     variable to 0 upon success.  It should be possible to use
     ‘GetLastError’ and ‘SetLastError’ when tasking, protected record,
     and exception features are not used, but it is not guaranteed to
     work.

   * It is not possible to link against Microsoft C++ libraries except
     for import libraries.  Interfacing must be done by the mean of
     DLLs.

   * It is possible to link against Microsoft C libraries.  Yet the
     preferred solution is to use C/C++ compiler that comes with GNAT,
     since it doesn’t require having two different development
     environments and makes the inter-language debugging experience
     smoother.

   * When the compilation environment is located on FAT32 drives, users
     may experience recompilations of the source files that have not
     changed if Daylight Saving Time (DST) state has changed since the
     last time files were compiled.  NTFS drives do not have this
     problem.

   * No components of the GNAT toolset use any entries in the Windows
     registry.  The only entries that can be created are file
     associations and PATH settings, provided the user has chosen to
     create them at installation time, as well as some minimal
     book-keeping information needed to correctly uninstall or integrate
     different GNAT products.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Using a network installation of GNAT,  Next: CONSOLE and WINDOWS subsystems,  Prev: Using GNAT on Windows,  Up: Microsoft Windows Topics

7.4.2 Using a network installation of GNAT
------------------------------------------

Make sure the system on which GNAT is installed is accessible from the
current machine, i.e., the install location is shared over the network.
Shared resources are accessed on Windows by means of UNC paths, which
have the format ‘\\\\server\\sharename\\path’

In order to use such a network installation, simply add the UNC path of
the ‘bin’ directory of your GNAT installation in front of your PATH. For
example, if GNAT is installed in ‘\GNAT’ directory of a share location
called ‘c-drive’ on a machine ‘LOKI’, the following command will make it
available:

          $ path \\loki\c-drive\gnat\bin;%path%`

Be aware that every compilation using the network installation results
in the transfer of large amounts of data across the network and will
likely cause serious performance penalty.

7.4.3 CONSOLE and WINDOWS subsystems
------------------------------------

There are two main subsystems under Windows.  The ‘CONSOLE’ subsystem
(which is the default subsystem) will always create a console when
launching the application.  This is not something desirable when the
application has a Windows GUI. To get rid of this console the
application must be using the ‘WINDOWS’ subsystem.  To do so the
‘-mwindows’ linker option must be specified.

          $ gnatmake winprog -largs -mwindows


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Temporary Files,  Next: Disabling Command Line Argument Expansion,  Prev: CONSOLE and WINDOWS subsystems,  Up: Microsoft Windows Topics

7.4.4 Temporary Files
---------------------

It is possible to control where temporary files gets created by setting
the ‘TMP’ environment variable.  The file will be created:

   * Under the directory pointed to by the ‘TMP’ environment variable if
     this directory exists.

   * Under ‘c:\temp’, if the ‘TMP’ environment variable is not set (or
     not pointing to a directory) and if this directory exists.

   * Under the current working directory otherwise.

This allows you to determine exactly where the temporary file will be
created.  This is particularly useful in networked environments where
you may not have write access to some directories.


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Disabling Command Line Argument Expansion,  Next: Windows Socket Timeouts,  Prev: Temporary Files,  Up: Microsoft Windows Topics

7.4.5 Disabling Command Line Argument Expansion
-----------------------------------------------

By default, an executable compiled for the Windows platform will do the
following postprocessing on the arguments passed on the command line:

   * If the argument contains the characters ‘*’ and/or ‘?’, then file
     expansion will be attempted.  For example, if the current directory
     contains ‘a.txt’ and ‘b.txt’, then when calling:

          $ my_ada_program *.txt

     The following arguments will effectively be passed to the main
     program (for example when using ‘Ada.Command_Line.Argument’):

          Ada.Command_Line.Argument (1) -> "a.txt"
          Ada.Command_Line.Argument (2) -> "b.txt"

   * Filename expansion can be disabled for a given argument by using
     single quotes.  Thus, calling:

          $ my_ada_program '*.txt'

     will result in:

          Ada.Command_Line.Argument (1) -> "*.txt"

Note that if the program is launched from a shell such as Cygwin Bash
then quote removal might be performed by the shell.

In some contexts it might be useful to disable this feature (for example
if the program performs its own argument expansion).  In order to do
this, a C symbol needs to be defined and set to ‘0’.  You can do this by
adding the following code fragment in one of your Ada units:

     Do_Argv_Expansion : Integer := 0;
     pragma Export (C, Do_Argv_Expansion, "__gnat_do_argv_expansion");

The results of previous examples will be respectively:

     Ada.Command_Line.Argument (1) -> "*.txt"

and:

     Ada.Command_Line.Argument (1) -> "'*.txt'"

7.4.6 Windows Socket Timeouts
-----------------------------

Microsoft Windows desktops older than ‘8.0’ and Microsoft Windows
Servers older than ‘2019’ set a socket timeout 500 milliseconds longer
than the value set by setsockopt with ‘SO_RCVTIMEO’ and ‘SO_SNDTIMEO’
options.  The GNAT runtime makes a correction for the difference in the
corresponding Windows versions.  For Windows Server starting with
version ‘2019’, the user must provide a manifest file for the GNAT
runtime to be able to recognize that the Windows version does not need
the timeout correction.  The manifest file should be located in the same
directory as the executable file, and its file name must match the
executable name suffixed by ‘.manifest’.  For example, if the executable
name is ‘sock_wto.exe’, then the manifest file name has to be
‘sock_wto.exe.manifest’.  The manifest file must contain at least the
following data:

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
     <assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0">
     <compatibility xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:compatibility.v1">
     <application>
        <!-- Windows Vista -->
        <supportedOS Id="{e2011457-1546-43c5-a5fe-008deee3d3f0}"/>
        <!-- Windows 7 -->
        <supportedOS Id="{35138b9a-5d96-4fbd-8e2d-a2440225f93a}"/>
        <!-- Windows 8 -->
        <supportedOS Id="{4a2f28e3-53b9-4441-ba9c-d69d4a4a6e38}"/>
        <!-- Windows 8.1 -->
        <supportedOS Id="{1f676c76-80e1-4239-95bb-83d0f6d0da78}"/>
        <!-- Windows 10 -->
        <supportedOS Id="{8e0f7a12-bfb3-4fe8-b9a5-48fd50a15a9a}"/>
     </application>
     </compatibility>
     </assembly>

Without the manifest file, the socket timeout is going to be
overcorrected on these Windows Server versions and the actual time is
going to be 500 milliseconds shorter than what was set with
GNAT.Sockets.Set_Socket_Option.  Note that on Microsoft Windows versions
where correction is necessary, there is no way to set a socket timeout
shorter than 500 ms.  If a socket timeout shorter than 500 ms is needed
on these Windows versions, a call to Check_Selector should be added
before any socket read or write operations.

7.4.7 Mixed-Language Programming on Windows
-------------------------------------------

Developing pure Ada applications on Windows is no different than on
other GNAT-supported platforms.  However, when developing or porting an
application that contains a mix of Ada and C/C++, the choice of your
Windows C/C++ development environment conditions your overall
interoperability strategy.

If you use ‘gcc’ or Microsoft C to compile the non-Ada part of your
application, there are no Windows-specific restrictions that affect the
overall interoperability with your Ada code.  If you do want to use the
Microsoft tools for your C++ code, you have two choices:

   * Encapsulate your C++ code in a DLL to be linked with your Ada
     application.  In this case, use the Microsoft or whatever
     environment to build the DLL and use GNAT to build your executable
     (*note Using DLLs with GNAT: 1d3.).

   * Or you can encapsulate your Ada code in a DLL to be linked with the
     other part of your application.  In this case, use GNAT to build
     the DLL (*note Building DLLs with GNAT Project files: 1d4.) and use
     the Microsoft or whatever environment to build your executable.

In addition to the description about C main in *note Mixed Language
Programming: 2c. section, if the C main uses a stand-alone library it is
required on x86-windows to setup the SEH context.  For this the C main
must looks like this:

          /* main.c */
          extern void adainit (void);
          extern void adafinal (void);
          extern void __gnat_initialize(void*);
          extern void call_to_ada (void);

          int main (int argc, char *argv[])
          {
            int SEH [2];

            /* Initialize the SEH context */
            __gnat_initialize (&SEH);

            adainit();

            /* Then call Ada services in the stand-alone library */

            call_to_ada();

            adafinal();
          }

Note that this is not needed on x86_64-windows where the Windows native
SEH support is used.

7.4.7.1 Windows Calling Conventions
...................................

This section pertain only to Win32.  On Win64 there is a single native
calling convention.  All convention specifiers are ignored on this
platform.

When a subprogram ‘F’ (caller) calls a subprogram ‘G’ (callee), there
are several ways to push ‘G’‘s parameters on the stack and there are
several possible scenarios to clean up the stack upon ‘G’‘s return.  A
calling convention is an agreed upon software protocol whereby the
responsibilities between the caller (‘F’) and the callee (‘G’) are
clearly defined.  Several calling conventions are available for Windows:

   * ‘C’ (Microsoft defined)

   * ‘Stdcall’ (Microsoft defined)

   * ‘Win32’ (GNAT specific)

   * ‘DLL’ (GNAT specific)

* Menu:

* C Calling Convention::
* Stdcall Calling Convention::
* Win32 Calling Convention::
* DLL Calling Convention::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: C Calling Convention,  Next: Stdcall Calling Convention,  Up: Windows Calling Conventions

7.4.7.2 ‘C’ Calling Convention
..............................

This is the default calling convention used when interfacing to C/C++
routines compiled with either ‘gcc’ or Microsoft Visual C++.

In the ‘C’ calling convention subprogram parameters are pushed on the
stack by the caller from right to left.  The caller itself is in charge
of cleaning up the stack after the call.  In addition, the name of a
routine with ‘C’ calling convention is mangled by adding a leading
underscore.

The name to use on the Ada side when importing (or exporting) a routine
with ‘C’ calling convention is the name of the routine.  For instance
the C function:

          int get_val (long);

should be imported from Ada as follows:

          function Get_Val (V : Interfaces.C.long) return Interfaces.C.int;
          pragma Import (C, Get_Val, External_Name => "get_val");

Note that in this particular case the ‘External_Name’ parameter could
have been omitted since, when missing, this parameter is taken to be the
name of the Ada entity in lower case.  When the ‘Link_Name’ parameter is
missing, as in the above example, this parameter is set to be the
‘External_Name’ with a leading underscore.

When importing a variable defined in C, you should always use the ‘C’
calling convention unless the object containing the variable is part of
a DLL (in which case you should use the ‘Stdcall’ calling convention,
*note Stdcall Calling Convention: 1d9.).

7.4.7.3 ‘Stdcall’ Calling Convention
....................................

This convention, which was the calling convention used for Pascal
programs, is used by Microsoft for all the routines in the Win32 API for
efficiency reasons.  It must be used to import any routine for which
this convention was specified.

In the ‘Stdcall’ calling convention subprogram parameters are pushed on
the stack by the caller from right to left.  The callee (and not the
caller) is in charge of cleaning the stack on routine exit.  In
addition, the name of a routine with ‘Stdcall’ calling convention is
mangled by adding a leading underscore (as for the ‘C’ calling
convention) and a trailing ‘@NN’, where ‘nn’ is the overall size (in
bytes) of the parameters passed to the routine.

The name to use on the Ada side when importing a C routine with a
‘Stdcall’ calling convention is the name of the C routine.  The leading
underscore and trailing ‘@NN’ are added automatically by the compiler.
For instance the Win32 function:

          APIENTRY int get_val (long);

should be imported from Ada as follows:

          function Get_Val (V : Interfaces.C.long) return Interfaces.C.int;
          pragma Import (Stdcall, Get_Val);
          --  On the x86 a long is 4 bytes, so the Link_Name is "_get_val@4"

As for the ‘C’ calling convention, when the ‘External_Name’ parameter is
missing, it is taken to be the name of the Ada entity in lower case.  If
instead of writing the above import pragma you write:

          function Get_Val (V : Interfaces.C.long) return Interfaces.C.int;
          pragma Import (Stdcall, Get_Val, External_Name => "retrieve_val");

then the imported routine is ‘_retrieve_val@4’.  However, if instead of
specifying the ‘External_Name’ parameter you specify the ‘Link_Name’ as
in the following example:

          function Get_Val (V : Interfaces.C.long) return Interfaces.C.int;
          pragma Import (Stdcall, Get_Val, Link_Name => "retrieve_val");

then the imported routine is ‘retrieve_val’, that is, there is no
decoration at all.  No leading underscore and no Stdcall suffix ‘@NN’.

This is especially important as in some special cases a DLL’s entry
point name lacks a trailing ‘@NN’ while the exported name generated for
a call has it.

It is also possible to import variables defined in a DLL by using an
import pragma for a variable.  As an example, if a DLL contains a
variable defined as:

          int my_var;

then, to access this variable from Ada you should write:

          My_Var : Interfaces.C.int;
          pragma Import (Stdcall, My_Var);

Note that to ease building cross-platform bindings this convention will
be handled as a ‘C’ calling convention on non-Windows platforms.

7.4.7.6 Introduction to Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)
.....................................................

A Dynamically Linked Library (DLL) is a library that can be shared by
several applications running under Windows.  A DLL can contain any
number of routines and variables.

One advantage of DLLs is that you can change and enhance them without
forcing all the applications that depend on them to be relinked or
recompiled.  However, you should be aware than all calls to DLL routines
are slower since, as you will understand below, such calls are indirect.

To illustrate the remainder of this section, suppose that an application
wants to use the services of a DLL ‘API.dll’.  To use the services
provided by ‘API.dll’ you must statically link against the DLL or an
import library which contains a jump table with an entry for each
routine and variable exported by the DLL. In the Microsoft world this
import library is called ‘API.lib’.  When using GNAT this import library
is called either ‘libAPI.dll.a’, ‘libapi.dll.a’, ‘libAPI.a’ or
‘libapi.a’ (names are case insensitive).

After you have linked your application with the DLL or the import
library and you run your application, here is what happens:

   * Your application is loaded into memory.

   * The DLL ‘API.dll’ is mapped into the address space of your
     application.  This means that:

        - The DLL will use the stack of the calling thread.

        - The DLL will use the virtual address space of the calling
          process.

        - The DLL will allocate memory from the virtual address space of
          the calling process.

        - Handles (pointers) can be safely exchanged between routines in
          the DLL routines and routines in the application using the
          DLL.

   * The entries in the jump table (from the import library
     ‘libAPI.dll.a’ or ‘API.lib’ or automatically created when linking
     against a DLL) which is part of your application are initialized
     with the addresses of the routines and variables in ‘API.dll’.

   * If present in ‘API.dll’, routines ‘DllMain’ or ‘DllMainCRTStartup’
     are invoked.  These routines typically contain the initialization
     code needed for the well-being of the routines and variables
     exported by the DLL.

There is an additional point which is worth mentioning.  In the Windows
world there are two kind of DLLs: relocatable and non-relocatable DLLs.
Non-relocatable DLLs can only be loaded at a very specific address in
the target application address space.  If the addresses of two
non-relocatable DLLs overlap and these happen to be used by the same
application, a conflict will occur and the application will run
incorrectly.  Hence, when possible, it is always preferable to use and
build relocatable DLLs.  Both relocatable and non-relocatable DLLs are
supported by GNAT. Note that the ‘-s’ linker option (see GNU Linker
User’s Guide) removes the debugging symbols from the DLL but the DLL can
still be relocated.

As a side note, an interesting difference between Microsoft DLLs and
Unix shared libraries, is the fact that on most Unix systems all public
routines are exported by default in a Unix shared library, while under
Windows it is possible (but not required) to list exported routines in a
definition file (see *note The Definition File: 1e1.).

7.4.7.7 Using DLLs with GNAT
............................

To use the services of a DLL, say ‘API.dll’, in your Ada application you
must have:

   * The Ada spec for the routines and/or variables you want to access
     in ‘API.dll’.  If not available this Ada spec must be built from
     the C/C++ header files provided with the DLL.

   * The import library (‘libAPI.dll.a’ or ‘API.lib’).  As previously
     mentioned an import library is a statically linked library
     containing the import table which will be filled at load time to
     point to the actual ‘API.dll’ routines.  Sometimes you don’t have
     an import library for the DLL you want to use.  The following
     sections will explain how to build one.  Note that this is
     optional.

   * The actual DLL, ‘API.dll’.

Once you have all the above, to compile an Ada application that uses the
services of ‘API.dll’ and whose main subprogram is ‘My_Ada_App’, you
simply issue the command

          $ gnatmake my_ada_app -largs -lAPI

The argument ‘-largs -lAPI’ at the end of the ‘gnatmake’ command tells
the GNAT linker to look for an import library.  The linker will look for
a library name in this specific order:

   * ‘libAPI.dll.a’

   * ‘API.dll.a’

   * ‘libAPI.a’

   * ‘API.lib’

   * ‘libAPI.dll’

   * ‘API.dll’

The first three are the GNU style import libraries.  The third is the
Microsoft style import libraries.  The last two are the actual DLL
names.

Note that if the Ada package spec for ‘API.dll’ contains the following
pragma

          pragma Linker_Options ("-lAPI");

you do not have to add ‘-largs -lAPI’ at the end of the ‘gnatmake’
command.

If any one of the items above is missing you will have to create it
yourself.  The following sections explain how to do so using as an
example a fictitious DLL called ‘API.dll’.

* Creating an Import Library::

7.4.7.8 Creating an Ada Spec for the DLL Services
.................................................

A DLL typically comes with a C/C++ header file which provides the
definitions of the routines and variables exported by the DLL. The Ada
equivalent of this header file is a package spec that contains
definitions for the imported entities.  If the DLL you intend to use
does not come with an Ada spec you have to generate one such spec
yourself.  For example if the header file of ‘API.dll’ is a file ‘api.h’
containing the following two definitions:

          int some_var;
          int get (char *);

then the equivalent Ada spec could be:

          with Interfaces.C.Strings;
          package API is
             use Interfaces;

             Some_Var : C.int;
             function Get (Str : C.Strings.Chars_Ptr) return C.int;

          private
             pragma Import (C, Get);
             pragma Import (DLL, Some_Var);
          end API;

7.4.7.9 Creating an Import Library
..................................

If a Microsoft-style import library ‘API.lib’ or a GNAT-style import
library ‘libAPI.dll.a’ or ‘libAPI.a’ is available with ‘API.dll’ you can
skip this section.  You can also skip this section if ‘API.dll’ or
‘libAPI.dll’ is built with GNU tools as in this case it is possible to
link directly against the DLL. Otherwise read on.

The Definition File
...................

As previously mentioned, and unlike Unix systems, the list of symbols
that are exported from a DLL must be provided explicitly in Windows.
The main goal of a definition file is precisely that: list the symbols
exported by a DLL. A definition file (usually a file with a ‘.def’
suffix) has the following structure:

          [LIBRARY ``name``]
          [DESCRIPTION ``string``]
          EXPORTS
             ``symbol1``
             ``symbol2``
             ...

‘LIBRARY name’

     This section, which is optional, gives the name of the DLL.

‘DESCRIPTION string’

     This section, which is optional, gives a description string that
     will be embedded in the import library.

‘EXPORTS’

     This section gives the list of exported symbols (procedures,
     functions or variables).  For instance in the case of ‘API.dll’ the
     ‘EXPORTS’ section of ‘API.def’ looks like:

          EXPORTS
             some_var
             get

Note that you must specify the correct suffix (‘@NN’) (see *note Windows
Calling Conventions: 1d6.) for a Stdcall calling convention function in
the exported symbols list.

There can actually be other sections in a definition file, but these
sections are not relevant to the discussion at hand.

Creating a Definition File Automatically
........................................

You can automatically create the definition file ‘API.def’ (see *note
The Definition File: 1e1.) from a DLL. For that use the ‘dlltool’
program as follows:

          $ dlltool API.dll -z API.def --export-all-symbols

     Note that if some routines in the DLL have the ‘Stdcall’ convention
     (*note Windows Calling Conventions: 1d6.) with stripped ‘@NN’
     suffix then you’ll have to edit ‘api.def’ to add it, and specify
     ‘-k’ to ‘gnatdll’ when creating the import library.

     Here are some hints to find the right ‘@NN’ suffix.

        - If you have the Microsoft import library (.lib), it is
          possible to get the right symbols by using Microsoft ‘dumpbin’
          tool (see the corresponding Microsoft documentation for
          further details).

               $ dumpbin /exports api.lib

        - If you have a message about a missing symbol at link time the
          compiler tells you what symbol is expected.  You just have to
          go back to the definition file and add the right suffix.

GNAT-Style Import Library
.........................

To create a static import library from ‘API.dll’ with the GNAT tools you
should create the .def file, then use ‘gnatdll’ tool (see *note Using
gnatdll: 1e9.) as follows:

          $ gnatdll -e API.def -d API.dll

     ‘gnatdll’ takes as input a definition file ‘API.def’ and the name
     of the DLL containing the services listed in the definition file
     ‘API.dll’.  The name of the static import library generated is
     computed from the name of the definition file as follows: if the
     definition file name is ‘xyz.def’, the import library name will be
     ‘libxyz.a’.  Note that in the previous example option ‘-e’ could
     have been removed because the name of the definition file (before
     the ‘.def’ suffix) is the same as the name of the DLL (*note Using
     gnatdll: 1e9. for more information about ‘gnatdll’).

Microsoft-Style Import Library
..............................

A Microsoft import library is needed only if you plan to make an Ada DLL
available to applications developed with Microsoft tools (*note
Mixed-Language Programming on Windows: 1d2.).

To create a Microsoft-style import library for ‘API.dll’ you should
create the .def file, then build the actual import library using
Microsoft’s ‘lib’ utility:

          $ lib -machine:IX86 -def:API.def -out:API.lib

     If you use the above command the definition file ‘API.def’ must
     contain a line giving the name of the DLL:

          LIBRARY      "API"

     See the Microsoft documentation for further details about the usage
     of ‘lib’.

7.4.7.10 Building DLLs with GNAT Project files
..............................................

There is nothing specific to Windows in the build process.  See the
‘Library Projects’ section in the ‘GNAT Project Manager’ chapter of the
‘GPRbuild User’s Guide’.

Due to a system limitation, it is not possible under Windows to create
threads when inside the ‘DllMain’ routine which is used for
auto-initialization of shared libraries, so it is not possible to have
library level tasks in SALs.

7.4.7.11 Building DLLs with GNAT
................................

This section explain how to build DLLs using the GNAT built-in DLL
support.  With the following procedure it is straight forward to build
and use DLLs with GNAT.

   * Building object files.  The first step is to build all objects
     files that are to be included into the DLL. This is done by using
     the standard ‘gnatmake’ tool.

   * Building the DLL. To build the DLL you must use the ‘gcc’ ‘-shared’
     and ‘-shared-libgcc’ options.  It is quite simple to use this
     method:

          $ gcc -shared -shared-libgcc -o api.dll obj1.o obj2.o ...

     It is important to note that in this case all symbols found in the
     object files are automatically exported.  It is possible to
     restrict the set of symbols to export by passing to ‘gcc’ a
     definition file (see *note The Definition File: 1e1.).  For
     example:

          $ gcc -shared -shared-libgcc -o api.dll api.def obj1.o obj2.o ...

     If you use a definition file you must export the elaboration
     procedures for every package that required one.  Elaboration
     procedures are named using the package name followed by “_E”.

   * Preparing DLL to be used.  For the DLL to be used by client
     programs the bodies must be hidden from it and the .ali set with
     read-only attribute.  This is very important otherwise GNAT will
     recompile all packages and will not actually use the code in the
     DLL. For example:

          $ mkdir apilib
          $ copy *.ads *.ali api.dll apilib
          $ attrib +R apilib\\*.ali

At this point it is possible to use the DLL by directly linking against
it.  Note that you must use the GNAT shared runtime when using GNAT
shared libraries.  This is achieved by using the ‘-shared’ binder
option.

          $ gnatmake main -Iapilib -bargs -shared -largs -Lapilib -lAPI

7.4.7.12 Building DLLs with gnatdll
...................................

Note that it is preferred to use GNAT Project files (*note Building DLLs
with GNAT Project files: 1d4.) or the built-in GNAT DLL support (*note
Building DLLs with GNAT: 1ec.) or to build DLLs.

This section explains how to build DLLs containing Ada code using
‘gnatdll’.  These DLLs will be referred to as Ada DLLs in the remainder
of this section.

The steps required to build an Ada DLL that is to be used by Ada as well
as non-Ada applications are as follows:

   * You need to mark each Ada entity exported by the DLL with a ‘C’ or
     ‘Stdcall’ calling convention to avoid any Ada name mangling for the
     entities exported by the DLL (see *note Exporting Ada Entities:
     1f0.).  You can skip this step if you plan to use the Ada DLL only
     from Ada applications.

   * Your Ada code must export an initialization routine which calls the
     routine ‘adainit’ generated by ‘gnatbind’ to perform the
     elaboration of the Ada code in the DLL (*note Ada DLLs and
     Elaboration: 1f1.).  The initialization routine exported by the Ada
     DLL must be invoked by the clients of the DLL to initialize the
     DLL.

   * When useful, the DLL should also export a finalization routine
     which calls routine ‘adafinal’ generated by ‘gnatbind’ to perform
     the finalization of the Ada code in the DLL (*note Ada DLLs and
     Finalization: 1f2.).  The finalization routine exported by the Ada
     DLL must be invoked by the clients of the DLL when the DLL services
     are no further needed.

   * You must provide a spec for the services exported by the Ada DLL in
     each of the programming languages to which you plan to make the DLL
     available.

   * You must provide a definition file listing the exported entities
     (*note The Definition File: 1e1.).

   * Finally you must use ‘gnatdll’ to produce the DLL and the import
     library (*note Using gnatdll: 1e9.).

Note that a relocatable DLL stripped using the ‘strip’ binutils tool
will not be relocatable anymore.  To build a DLL without debug
information pass ‘-largs -s’ to ‘gnatdll’.  This restriction does not
apply to a DLL built using a Library Project.  See the ‘Library
Projects’ section in the ‘GNAT Project Manager’ chapter of the ‘GPRbuild
User’s Guide’.

7.4.7.13 Limitations When Using Ada DLLs from Ada
.................................................

When using Ada DLLs from Ada applications there is a limitation users
should be aware of.  Because on Windows the GNAT run-time is not in a
DLL of its own, each Ada DLL includes a part of the GNAT run-time.
Specifically, each Ada DLL includes the services of the GNAT run-time
that are necessary to the Ada code inside the DLL. As a result, when an
Ada program uses an Ada DLL there are two independent GNAT run-times:
one in the Ada DLL and one in the main program.

It is therefore not possible to exchange GNAT run-time objects between
the Ada DLL and the main Ada program.  Example of GNAT run-time objects
are file handles (e.g., ‘Text_IO.File_Type’), tasks types, protected
objects types, etc.

It is completely safe to exchange plain elementary, array or record
types, Windows object handles, etc.

7.4.7.14 Exporting Ada Entities
...............................

Building a DLL is a way to encapsulate a set of services usable from any
application.  As a result, the Ada entities exported by a DLL should be
exported with the ‘C’ or ‘Stdcall’ calling conventions to avoid any Ada
name mangling.  As an example here is an Ada package ‘API’, spec and
body, exporting two procedures, a function, and a variable:

          with Interfaces.C; use Interfaces;
          package API is
             Count : C.int := 0;
             function Factorial (Val : C.int) return C.int;

             procedure Initialize_API;
             procedure Finalize_API;
             --  Initialization & Finalization routines. More in the next section.
          private
             pragma Export (C, Initialize_API);
             pragma Export (C, Finalize_API);
             pragma Export (C, Count);
             pragma Export (C, Factorial);
          end API;

          package body API is
             function Factorial (Val : C.int) return C.int is
                Fact : C.int := 1;
             begin
                Count := Count + 1;
                for K in 1 .. Val loop
                   Fact := Fact * K;
                end loop;
                return Fact;
             end Factorial;

             procedure Initialize_API is
                procedure Adainit;
                pragma Import (C, Adainit);
             begin
                Adainit;
             end Initialize_API;

             procedure Finalize_API is
                procedure Adafinal;
                pragma Import (C, Adafinal);
             begin
                Adafinal;
             end Finalize_API;
          end API;

If the Ada DLL you are building will only be used by Ada applications
you do not have to export Ada entities with a ‘C’ or ‘Stdcall’
convention.  As an example, the previous package could be written as
follows:

          package API is
             Count : Integer := 0;
             function Factorial (Val : Integer) return Integer;

             procedure Initialize_API;
             procedure Finalize_API;
             --  Initialization and Finalization routines.
          end API;

          package body API is
             function Factorial (Val : Integer) return Integer is
                Fact : Integer := 1;
             begin
                Count := Count + 1;
                for K in 1 .. Val loop
                   Fact := Fact * K;
                end loop;
                return Fact;
             end Factorial;

             ...
             --  The remainder of this package body is unchanged.
          end API;

Note that if you do not export the Ada entities with a ‘C’ or ‘Stdcall’
convention you will have to provide the mangled Ada names in the
definition file of the Ada DLL (*note Creating the Definition File:

7.4.7.15 Ada DLLs and Elaboration
.................................

The DLL that you are building contains your Ada code as well as all the
routines in the Ada library that are needed by it.  The first thing a
user of your DLL must do is elaborate the Ada code (*note Elaboration
Order Handling in GNAT: f.).

To achieve this you must export an initialization routine
(‘Initialize_API’ in the previous example), which must be invoked before
using any of the DLL services.  This elaboration routine must call the
Ada elaboration routine ‘adainit’ generated by the GNAT binder (*note
Binding with Non-Ada Main Programs: 7e.).  See the body of
‘Initialize_Api’ for an example.  Note that the GNAT binder is
automatically invoked during the DLL build process by the ‘gnatdll’ tool
(*note Using gnatdll: 1e9.).

When a DLL is loaded, Windows systematically invokes a routine called
‘DllMain’.  It would therefore be possible to call ‘adainit’ directly
from ‘DllMain’ without having to provide an explicit initialization
routine.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to call ‘adainit’ from the
‘DllMain’ if your program has library level tasks because access to the
‘DllMain’ entry point is serialized by the system (that is, only a
single thread can execute ‘through’ it at a time), which means that the
GNAT run-time will deadlock waiting for the newly created task to
complete its initialization.

7.4.7.16 Ada DLLs and Finalization
..................................

When the services of an Ada DLL are no longer needed, the client code
should invoke the DLL finalization routine, if available.  The DLL
finalization routine is in charge of releasing all resources acquired by
the DLL. In the case of the Ada code contained in the DLL, this is
achieved by calling routine ‘adafinal’ generated by the GNAT binder
(*note Binding with Non-Ada Main Programs: 7e.).  See the body of
‘Finalize_Api’ for an example.  As already pointed out the GNAT binder
is automatically invoked during the DLL build process by the ‘gnatdll’
tool (*note Using gnatdll: 1e9.).

7.4.7.17 Creating a Spec for Ada DLLs
.....................................

To use the services exported by the Ada DLL from another programming
language (e.g., C), you have to translate the specs of the exported Ada
entities in that language.  For instance in the case of ‘API.dll’, the
corresponding C header file could look like:

          extern int *_imp__count;
          #define count (*_imp__count)
          int factorial (int);

It is important to understand that when building an Ada DLL to be used
by other Ada applications, you need two different specs for the packages
contained in the DLL: one for building the DLL and the other for using
the DLL. This is because the ‘DLL’ calling convention is needed to use a
variable defined in a DLL, but when building the DLL, the variable must
have either the ‘Ada’ or ‘C’ calling convention.  As an example consider
a DLL comprising the following package ‘API’:

          package API is
             Count : Integer := 0;
             ...
             --  Remainder of the package omitted.
          end API;

After producing a DLL containing package ‘API’, the spec that must be
used to import ‘API.Count’ from Ada code outside of the DLL is:

          package API is
             Count : Integer;
             pragma Import (DLL, Count);
          end API;

File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Creating the Definition File,  Next: Using gnatdll,  Up: Creating a Spec for Ada DLLs

7.4.7.18 Creating the Definition File
.....................................

The definition file is the last file needed to build the DLL. It lists
the exported symbols.  As an example, the definition file for a DLL
containing only package ‘API’ (where all the entities are exported with
a ‘C’ calling convention) is:

          EXPORTS
              count
              factorial
              finalize_api
              initialize_api

If the ‘C’ calling convention is missing from package ‘API’, then the
definition file contains the mangled Ada names of the above entities,
which in this case are:

          EXPORTS
              api__count
              api__factorial
              api__finalize_api
              api__initialize_api

7.4.7.19 Using ‘gnatdll’
........................

‘gnatdll’ is a tool to automate the DLL build process once all the Ada
and non-Ada sources that make up your DLL have been compiled.  ‘gnatdll’
is actually in charge of two distinct tasks: build the static import
library for the DLL and the actual DLL. The form of the ‘gnatdll’
command is

          $ gnatdll [ switches ] list-of-files [ -largs opts ]

where ‘list-of-files’ is a list of ALI and object files.  The object
file list must be the exact list of objects corresponding to the non-Ada
sources whose services are to be included in the DLL. The ALI file list
must be the exact list of ALI files for the corresponding Ada sources
whose services are to be included in the DLL. If ‘list-of-files’ is
missing, only the static import library is generated.

You may specify any of the following switches to ‘gnatdll’:

‘-a[`address']’

     Build a non-relocatable DLL at ‘address’.  If ‘address’ is not
     specified the default address ‘0x11000000’ will be used.  By
     default, when this switch is missing, ‘gnatdll’ builds relocatable
     DLL. We advise the reader to build relocatable DLL.

‘-b `address'’

     Set the relocatable DLL base address.  By default the address is
     ‘0x11000000’.

‘-bargs `opts'’

     Binder options.  Pass ‘opts’ to the binder.

‘-d `dllfile'’

     ‘dllfile’ is the name of the DLL. This switch must be present for
     ‘gnatdll’ to do anything.  The name of the generated import library
     is obtained algorithmically from ‘dllfile’ as shown in the
     following example: if ‘dllfile’ is ‘xyz.dll’, the import library
     name is ‘libxyz.dll.a’.  The name of the definition file to use (if
     not specified by option ‘-e’) is obtained algorithmically from
     ‘dllfile’ as shown in the following example: if ‘dllfile’ is
     ‘xyz.dll’, the definition file used is ‘xyz.def’.

‘-e `deffile'’

     ‘deffile’ is the name of the definition file.

‘-g’

     Generate debugging information.  This information is stored in the
     object file and copied from there to the final DLL file by the
     linker, where it can be read by the debugger.  You must use the
     ‘-g’ switch if you plan on using the debugger or the symbolic stack
     traceback.

‘-h’

     Help mode.  Displays ‘gnatdll’ switch usage information.

‘-I`dir'’

     Direct ‘gnatdll’ to search the ‘dir’ directory for source and
     object files needed to build the DLL. (*note Search Paths and the
     Run-Time Library (RTL): 73.).

‘-k’

     Removes the ‘@NN’ suffix from the import library’s exported names,
     but keeps them for the link names.  You must specify this option if
     you want to use a ‘Stdcall’ function in a DLL for which the ‘@NN’
     suffix has been removed.  This is the case for most of the Windows
     NT DLL for example.  This option has no effect when ‘-n’ option is
     specified.

‘-l `file'’

     The list of ALI and object files used to build the DLL are listed
     in ‘file’, instead of being given in the command line.  Each line
     in ‘file’ contains the name of an ALI or object file.

‘-n’

     No Import.  Do not create the import library.

‘-q’

     Quiet mode.  Do not display unnecessary messages.

‘-v’

     Verbose mode.  Display extra information.

‘-largs `opts'’

     Linker options.  Pass ‘opts’ to the linker.

‘gnatdll’ Example
.................

As an example the command to build a relocatable DLL from ‘api.adb’ once
‘api.adb’ has been compiled and ‘api.def’ created is

          $ gnatdll -d api.dll api.ali

The above command creates two files: ‘libapi.dll.a’ (the import library)
and ‘api.dll’ (the actual DLL). If you want to create only the DLL, just
type:

          $ gnatdll -d api.dll -n api.ali

Alternatively if you want to create just the import library, type:

          $ gnatdll -d api.dll

‘gnatdll’ behind the Scenes
...........................

This section details the steps involved in creating a DLL. ‘gnatdll’
does these steps for you.  Unless you are interested in understanding
what goes on behind the scenes, you should skip this section.

We use the previous example of a DLL containing the Ada package ‘API’,
to illustrate the steps necessary to build a DLL. The starting point is
a set of objects that will make up the DLL and the corresponding ALI
files.  In the case of this example this means that ‘api.o’ and
‘api.ali’ are available.  To build a relocatable DLL, ‘gnatdll’ does the
following:

   * ‘gnatdll’ builds the base file (‘api.base’).  A base file gives the
     information necessary to generate relocation information for the
     DLL.

          $ gnatbind -n api
          $ gnatlink api -o api.jnk -mdll -Wl,--base-file,api.base

     In addition to the base file, the ‘gnatlink’ command generates an
     output file ‘api.jnk’ which can be discarded.  The ‘-mdll’ switch
     asks ‘gnatlink’ to generate the routines ‘DllMain’ and
     ‘DllMainCRTStartup’ that are called by the Windows loader when the
     DLL is loaded into memory.

   * ‘gnatdll’ uses ‘dlltool’ (see *note Using dlltool: 1fc.) to build
     the export table (‘api.exp’).  The export table contains the
     relocation information in a form which can be used during the final
     link to ensure that the Windows loader is able to place the DLL
     anywhere in memory.

          $ dlltool --dllname api.dll --def api.def --base-file api.base \\
                    --output-exp api.exp

   * ‘gnatdll’ builds the base file using the new export table.  Note
     that ‘gnatbind’ must be called once again since the binder
     generated file has been deleted during the previous call to
     ‘gnatlink’.

          $ gnatbind -n api
          $ gnatlink api -o api.jnk api.exp -mdll
                -Wl,--base-file,api.base

   * ‘gnatdll’ builds the new export table using the new base file and
     generates the DLL import library ‘libAPI.dll.a’.

          $ dlltool --dllname api.dll --def api.def --base-file api.base \\
                    --output-exp api.exp --output-lib libAPI.a

   * Finally ‘gnatdll’ builds the relocatable DLL using the final export
     table.

          $ gnatbind -n api
          $ gnatlink api api.exp -o api.dll -mdll

Using ‘dlltool’
...............

‘dlltool’ is the low-level tool used by ‘gnatdll’ to build DLLs and
static import libraries.  This section summarizes the most common
‘dlltool’ switches.  The form of the ‘dlltool’ command is

          $ dlltool [`switches`]

‘dlltool’ switches include:

‘--base-file `basefile'’

     Read the base file ‘basefile’ generated by the linker.  This switch
     is used to create a relocatable DLL.

‘--def `deffile'’

     Read the definition file.

‘--dllname `name'’

     Gives the name of the DLL. This switch is used to embed the name of
     the DLL in the static import library generated by ‘dlltool’ with
     switch ‘--output-lib’.

‘-k’

     Kill ‘@NN’ from exported names (*note Windows Calling Conventions:
     1d6. for a discussion about ‘Stdcall’-style symbols).

‘--help’

     Prints the ‘dlltool’ switches with a concise description.

‘--output-exp `exportfile'’

     Generate an export file ‘exportfile’.  The export file contains the
     export table (list of symbols in the DLL) and is used to create the
     DLL.

‘--output-lib `libfile'’

     Generate a static import library ‘libfile’.

‘-v’

     Verbose mode.

‘--as `assembler-name'’

     Use ‘assembler-name’ as the assembler.  The default is ‘as’.

7.4.7.20 GNAT and Windows Resources
...................................

Resources are an easy way to add Windows specific objects to your
application.  The objects that can be added as resources include:

   * menus

   * accelerators

   * dialog boxes

   * string tables

   * bitmaps

   * cursors

   * icons

   * fonts

   * version information

For example, a version information resource can be defined as follow and
embedded into an executable or DLL:

A version information resource can be used to embed information into an
executable or a DLL. These information can be viewed using the file
properties from the Windows Explorer.  Here is an example of a version
information resource:

          1 VERSIONINFO
          FILEVERSION     1,0,0,0
          PRODUCTVERSION  1,0,0,0
          BEGIN
            BLOCK "StringFileInfo"
            BEGIN
              BLOCK "080904E4"
              BEGIN
                VALUE "CompanyName", "My Company Name"
                VALUE "FileDescription", "My application"
                VALUE "FileVersion", "1.0"
                VALUE "InternalName", "my_app"
                VALUE "LegalCopyright", "My Name"
                VALUE "OriginalFilename", "my_app.exe"
                VALUE "ProductName", "My App"
                VALUE "ProductVersion", "1.0"
              END
            END

            BLOCK "VarFileInfo"
            BEGIN
              VALUE "Translation", 0x809, 1252
            END
          END

The value ‘0809’ (langID) is for the U.K English language and ‘04E4’
(charsetID), which is equal to ‘1252’ decimal, for multilingual.

7.4.7.21 Building Resources
...........................

A resource file is an ASCII file.  By convention resource files have an
‘.rc’ extension.  The easiest way to build a resource file is to use
Microsoft tools such as ‘imagedit.exe’ to build bitmaps, icons and
cursors and ‘dlgedit.exe’ to build dialogs.  It is always possible to
build an ‘.rc’ file yourself by writing a resource script.

It is not our objective to explain how to write a resource file.  A
complete description of the resource script language can be found in the
Microsoft documentation.

7.4.7.22 Compiling Resources
............................

This section describes how to build a GNAT-compatible (COFF) object file
containing the resources.  This is done using the Resource Compiler
‘windres’ as follows:

          $ windres -i myres.rc -o myres.o

By default ‘windres’ will run ‘gcc’ to preprocess the ‘.rc’ file.  You
can specify an alternate preprocessor (usually named ‘cpp.exe’) using
the ‘windres’ ‘--preprocessor’ parameter.  A list of all possible
options may be obtained by entering the command ‘windres’ ‘--help’.

It is also possible to use the Microsoft resource compiler ‘rc.exe’ to
produce a ‘.res’ file (binary resource file).  See the corresponding
Microsoft documentation for further details.  In this case you need to
use ‘windres’ to translate the ‘.res’ file to a GNAT-compatible object
file as follows:

          $ windres -i myres.res -o myres.o

To include the resource file in your program just add the
GNAT-compatible object file for the resource(s) to the linker arguments.
With ‘gnatmake’ this is done by using the ‘-largs’ option:

7.4.7.24 Using GNAT DLLs from Microsoft Visual Studio Applications
..................................................................

This section describes a common case of mixed GNAT/Microsoft Visual
Studio application development, where the main program is developed
using MSVS, and is linked with a DLL developed using GNAT. Such a mixed
application should be developed following the general guidelines
outlined above; below is the cookbook-style sequence of steps to follow:

  1. First develop and build the GNAT shared library using a library
     project (let’s assume the project is ‘mylib.gpr’, producing the
     library ‘libmylib.dll’):

          $ gprbuild -p mylib.gpr

  2. Produce a .def file for the symbols you need to interface with,
     either by hand or automatically with possibly some manual
     adjustments (see *note Creating Definition File Automatically:
     1e7.):

          $ dlltool libmylib.dll -z libmylib.def --export-all-symbols

  3. Make sure that MSVS command-line tools are accessible on the path.

  4. Create the Microsoft-style import library (see *note MSVS-Style
     Import Library: 1ea.):

          $ lib -machine:IX86 -def:libmylib.def -out:libmylib.lib

If you are using a 64-bit toolchain, the above becomes…

          $ lib -machine:X64 -def:libmylib.def -out:libmylib.lib

  5. Build the C main

          $ cl /O2 /MD main.c libmylib.lib

  6. Before running the executable, make sure you have set the PATH to
     the DLL, or copy the DLL into into the directory containing the
     .exe.

7.4.7.25 Debugging a DLL
........................

Debugging a DLL is similar to debugging a standard program.  But we have
to deal with two different executable parts: the DLL and the program
that uses it.  We have the following four possibilities:

   * The program and the DLL are built with GCC/GNAT.

   * The program is built with foreign tools and the DLL is built with
     GCC/GNAT.

   * The program is built with GCC/GNAT and the DLL is built with
     foreign tools.

In this section we address only cases one and two above.  There is no
point in trying to debug a DLL with GNU/GDB, if there is no
GDB-compatible debugging information in it.  To do so you must use a
debugger compatible with the tools suite used to build the DLL.

* Menu:

* Program and DLL Both Built with GCC/GNAT::
* Program Built with Foreign Tools and DLL Built with GCC/GNAT::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Program and DLL Both Built with GCC/GNAT,  Next: Program Built with Foreign Tools and DLL Built with GCC/GNAT,  Up: Debugging a DLL

7.4.7.26 Program and DLL Both Built with GCC/GNAT
.................................................

This is the simplest case.  Both the DLL and the program have ‘GDB’
compatible debugging information.  It is then possible to break anywhere
in the process.  Let’s suppose here that the main procedure is named
‘ada_main’ and that in the DLL there is an entry point named ‘ada_dll’.

The DLL (*note Introduction to Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs): 1e0.) and
program must have been built with the debugging information (see GNAT -g
switch).  Here are the step-by-step instructions for debugging it:

   * Launch ‘GDB’ on the main program.

          $ gdb -nw ada_main

   * Start the program and stop at the beginning of the main procedure

          (gdb) start

     This step is required to be able to set a breakpoint inside the
     DLL. As long as the program is not run, the DLL is not loaded.
     This has the consequence that the DLL debugging information is also
     not loaded, so it is not possible to set a breakpoint in the DLL.

   * Set a breakpoint inside the DLL

          (gdb) break ada_dll
          (gdb) cont

At this stage a breakpoint is set inside the DLL. From there on you can
use the standard approach to debug the whole program (*note Running and
Debugging Ada Programs: 14f.).


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Program Built with Foreign Tools and DLL Built with GCC/GNAT,  Prev: Program and DLL Both Built with GCC/GNAT,  Up: Debugging a DLL

7.4.7.27 Program Built with Foreign Tools and DLL Built with GCC/GNAT
.....................................................................

In this case things are slightly more complex because it is not possible
to start the main program and then break at the beginning to load the
DLL and the associated DLL debugging information.  It is not possible to
break at the beginning of the program because there is no ‘GDB’
debugging information, and therefore there is no direct way of getting
initial control.  This section addresses this issue by describing some
methods that can be used to break somewhere in the DLL to debug it.

First suppose that the main procedure is named ‘main’ (this is for
example some C code built with Microsoft Visual C) and that there is a
DLL named ‘test.dll’ containing an Ada entry point named ‘ada_dll’.

The DLL (see *note Introduction to Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs): 1e0.)
must have been built with debugging information (see the GNAT ‘-g’
option).

Debugging the DLL Directly
..........................

   * Find out the executable starting address

          $ objdump --file-header main.exe

     The starting address is reported on the last line.  For example:

          main.exe:     file format pei-i386
          architecture: i386, flags 0x0000010a:
          EXEC_P, HAS_DEBUG, D_PAGED
          start address 0x00401010

   * Launch the debugger on the executable.

          $ gdb main.exe

   * Set a breakpoint at the starting address, and launch the program.

          $ (gdb) break *0x00401010
          $ (gdb) run

     The program will stop at the given address.

   * Set a breakpoint on a DLL subroutine.

          (gdb) break ada_dll.adb:45

     Or if you want to break using a symbol on the DLL, you need first
     to select the Ada language (language used by the DLL).

          (gdb) set language ada
          (gdb) break ada_dll

   * Continue the program.

          (gdb) cont

     This will run the program until it reaches the breakpoint that has
     been set.  From that point you can use the standard way to debug a
     program as described in (*note Running and Debugging Ada Programs:
     14f.).

It is also possible to debug the DLL by attaching to a running process.

Attaching to a Running Process
..............................

With ‘GDB’ it is always possible to debug a running process by attaching
to it.  It is possible to debug a DLL this way.  The limitation of this
approach is that the DLL must run long enough to perform the attach
operation.  It may be useful for instance to insert a time wasting loop
in the code of the DLL to meet this criterion.

   * Launch the main program ‘main.exe’.

          $ main

   * Use the Windows ‘Task Manager’ to find the process ID. Let’s say
     that the process PID for ‘main.exe’ is 208.

   * Launch gdb.

          $ gdb

   * Attach to the running process to be debugged.

          (gdb) attach 208

   * Load the process debugging information.

          (gdb) symbol-file main.exe

   * Break somewhere in the DLL.

          (gdb) break ada_dll

   * Continue process execution.

          (gdb) cont

This last step will resume the process execution, and stop at the
breakpoint we have set.  From there you can use the standard approach to
debug a program as described in *note Running and Debugging Ada
Programs: 14f.

7.4.7.28 Setting Stack Size from ‘gnatlink’
...........................................

It is possible to specify the program stack size at link time.  On
modern versions of Windows, starting with XP, this is mostly useful to
set the size of the main stack (environment task).  The other task
stacks are set with pragma Storage_Size or with the ‘gnatbind -d’
command.

Since older versions of Windows (2000, NT4, etc.)  do not allow setting
the reserve size of individual tasks, the link-time stack size applies
to all tasks, and pragma Storage_Size has no effect.  In particular,
Stack Overflow checks are made against this link-time specified size.

This setting can be done with ‘gnatlink’ using either of the following:

   * ‘-Xlinker’ linker option

          $ gnatlink hello -Xlinker --stack=0x10000,0x1000

     This sets the stack reserve size to 0x10000 bytes and the stack
     commit size to 0x1000 bytes.

   * ‘-Wl’ linker option

          $ gnatlink hello -Wl,--stack=0x1000000

     This sets the stack reserve size to 0x1000000 bytes.  Note that
     with ‘-Wl’ option it is not possible to set the stack commit size
     because the comma is a separator for this option.

7.4.7.29 Setting Heap Size from ‘gnatlink’
..........................................

Under Windows systems, it is possible to specify the program heap size
from ‘gnatlink’ using either of the following:

   * ‘-Xlinker’ linker option

          $ gnatlink hello -Xlinker --heap=0x10000,0x1000

     This sets the heap reserve size to 0x10000 bytes and the heap
     commit size to 0x1000 bytes.

   * ‘-Wl’ linker option

          $ gnatlink hello -Wl,--heap=0x1000000

     This sets the heap reserve size to 0x1000000 bytes.  Note that with
     ‘-Wl’ option it is not possible to set the heap commit size because
     the comma is a separator for this option.

7.4.8.1 Win32Ada
................

Win32Ada is a binding for the Microsoft Win32 API. This binding can be
easily installed from the provided installer.  To use the Win32Ada
binding you need to use a project file, and adding a single with_clause
will give you full access to the Win32Ada binding sources and ensure
that the proper libraries are passed to the linker.

          with "win32ada";
          project P is
             for Sources use ...;
          end P;

To build the application you just need to call gprbuild for the
application’s project, here p.gpr:

          gprbuild p.gpr

7.4.8.2 wPOSIX
..............

wPOSIX is a minimal POSIX binding whose goal is to help with building
cross-platforms applications.  This binding is not complete though, as
the Win32 API does not provide the necessary support for all POSIX APIs.

To use the wPOSIX binding you need to use a project file, and adding a
single with_clause will give you full access to the wPOSIX binding
sources and ensure that the proper libraries are passed to the linker.

          with "wposix";
          project P is
             for Sources use ...;
          end P;

To build the application you just need to call gprbuild for the

* Codesigning the Debugger::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Codesigning the Debugger,  Up: Mac OS Topics

7.5.1 Codesigning the Debugger
------------------------------

The Darwin Kernel requires the debugger to have special permissions
before it is allowed to control other processes.  These permissions are
granted by codesigning the GDB executable.  Without these permissions,
the debugger will report error messages such as:

     Starting program: /x/y/foo
     Unable to find Mach task port for process-id 28885: (os/kern) failure (0x5).
     (please check gdb is codesigned - see taskgated(8))

Codesigning requires a certificate.  The following procedure explains
how to create one:

   * Start the Keychain Access application (in
     /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app)

   * Select the Keychain Access -> Certificate Assistant -> Create a
     Certificate… menu

   * Then:

        * Choose a name for the new certificate (this procedure will use
          “gdb-cert” as an example)

        * Set “Identity Type” to “Self Signed Root”

        * Set “Certificate Type” to “Code Signing”

        * Activate the “Let me override defaults” option

   * Click several times on “Continue” until the “Specify a Location For
     The Certificate” screen appears, then set “Keychain” to “System”

   * Click on “Continue” until the certificate is created

   * Finally, in the view, double-click on the new certificate, and set
     “When using this certificate” to “Always Trust”

   * Exit the Keychain Access application and restart the computer (this
     is unfortunately required)

Once a certificate has been created, the debugger can be codesigned as
follow.  In a Terminal, run the following command:

          $ codesign -f -s  "gdb-cert"  <gnat_install_prefix>/bin/gdb

where “gdb-cert” should be replaced by the actual certificate name
chosen above, and <gnat_install_prefix> should be replaced by the
location where you installed GNAT. Also, be sure that users are in the
Unix group ‘_developer’.

           procedure initialize;
           pragma Import (C, initialize, "__gnat_initialize");

           --  The finalize routine performs low level system
           --  finalization using a standard library routine. The

           pragma Import (C, finalize, "__gnat_finalize");

           gnat_envp := envp;

           Initialize (SEH'Address);

           --  Call our generated Ada initialization routine

           adainit;

           --  Now we call the main program of the partition

           Ada_Main_Program;

           --  Perform Ada finalization

           adafinal;

           --  Perform low level system finalization

           Finalize;

           --  Return the proper exit status
           return (gnat_exit_status);
        end;

     --  This section is entirely comments, so it has no effect on the
     --  compilation of the Ada_Main package. It provides the list of
     --  object files and linker options, as well as some standard
     --  libraries needed for the link. The gnatlink utility parses
     --  this b~hello.adb file to read these comment lines to generate
     --  the appropriate command line arguments for the call to the
     --  system linker. The BEGIN/END lines are used for sentinels for
     --  this parsing operation.

     --  The exact file names will of course depend on the environment,
     --  host/target and location of files on the host system.

     -- BEGIN Object file/option list
        --   ./hello.o
        --   -L./
        --   -L/usr/local/gnat/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.8.1/adalib/
        --   /usr/local/gnat/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.8.1/adalib/libgnat.a
     -- END Object file/option list

     end ada_main;

The Ada code in the above example is exactly what is generated by the
binder.  We have added comments to more clearly indicate the function of
each part of the generated ‘Ada_Main’ package.

The code is standard Ada in all respects, and can be processed by any
tools that handle Ada.  In particular, it is possible to use the
debugger in Ada mode to debug the generated ‘Ada_Main’ package.  For
example, suppose that for reasons that you do not understand, your
program is crashing during elaboration of the body of ‘Ada.Text_IO’.  To
locate this bug, you can place a breakpoint on the call:

          Ada.Text_Io'Elab_Body;

and trace the elaboration routine for this package to find out where the
problem might be (more usually of course you would be debugging
elaboration code in your own application).

9.1 Elaboration Code
====================

Ada defines the term ‘execution’ as the process by which a construct
achieves its run-time effect.  This process is also referred to as
‘elaboration’ for declarations and ‘evaluation’ for expressions.

The execution model in Ada allows for certain sections of an Ada program
to be executed prior to execution of the program itself, primarily with
the intent of initializing data.  These sections are referred to as
‘elaboration code’.  Elaboration code is executed as follows:

   * All partitions of an Ada program are executed in parallel with one
     another, possibly in a separate address space, and possibly on a
     separate computer.

   * The execution of a partition involves running the environment task
     for that partition.

   * The environment task executes all elaboration code (if available)
     for all units within that partition.  This code is said to be
     executed at ‘elaboration time’.

   * The environment task executes the Ada program (if available) for
     that partition.

In addition to the Ada terminology, this appendix defines the following
terms:

   * ‘Invocation’

     The act of calling a subprogram, instantiating a generic, or
     activating a task.

   * ‘Scenario’

     A construct that is elaborated or invoked by elaboration code is
     referred to as an ‘elaboration scenario’ or simply a ‘scenario’.
     GNAT recognizes the following scenarios:

        - ‘'Access’ of entries, operators, and subprograms

        - Activation of tasks

        - Calls to entries, operators, and subprograms

        - Instantiations of generic templates

   * ‘Target’

     A construct elaborated by a scenario is referred to as ‘elaboration
     target’ or simply ‘target’.  GNAT recognizes the following targets:

        - For ‘'Access’ of entries, operators, and subprograms, the
          target is the entry, operator, or subprogram being aliased.

        - For activation of tasks, the target is the task body

        - For calls to entries, operators, and subprograms, the target
          is the entry, operator, or subprogram being invoked.

        - For instantiations of generic templates, the target is the
          generic template being instantiated.

Elaboration code may appear in two distinct contexts:

   * ‘Library level’

     A scenario appears at the library level when it is encapsulated by
     a package [body] compilation unit, ignoring any other package
     [body] declarations in between.

          with Server;
          package Client is
             procedure Proc;

             package Nested is
                Val : ... := Server.Func;
             end Nested;
          end Client;

     In the example above, the call to ‘Server.Func’ is an elaboration
     scenario because it appears at the library level of package
     ‘Client’.  Note that the declaration of package ‘Nested’ is ignored
     according to the definition given above.  As a result, the call to
     ‘Server.Func’ will be invoked when the spec of unit ‘Client’ is
     elaborated.

   * ‘Package body statements’

     A scenario appears within the statement sequence of a package body
     when it is bounded by the region starting from the ‘begin’ keyword
     of the package body and ending at the ‘end’ keyword of the package
     body.

          package body Client is
             procedure Proc is
             begin
                ...
             end Proc;
          begin
             Proc;
          end Client;

     In the example above, the call to ‘Proc’ is an elaboration scenario
     because it appears within the statement sequence of package body
     ‘Client’.  As a result, the call to ‘Proc’ will be invoked when the
     body of ‘Client’ is elaborated.

9.2 Elaboration Order
=====================

The sequence by which the elaboration code of all units within a
partition is executed is referred to as ‘elaboration order’.

Within a single unit, elaboration code is executed in sequential order.

          package body Client is
             Result : ... := Server.Func;

             procedure Proc is
                package Inst is new Server.Gen;
             begin
                Inst.Eval (Result);
             end Proc;
          begin
             Proc;
          end Client;

In the example above, the elaboration order within package body ‘Client’
is as follows:

  1. The object declaration of ‘Result’ is elaborated.

        * Function ‘Server.Func’ is invoked.

  2. The subprogram body of ‘Proc’ is elaborated.

  3. Procedure ‘Proc’ is invoked.

        * Generic unit ‘Server.Gen’ is instantiated as ‘Inst’.

        * Instance ‘Inst’ is elaborated.

        * Procedure ‘Inst.Eval’ is invoked.

The elaboration order of all units within a partition depends on the
following factors:

   * ‘with’ed units

   * parent units

   * purity of units

   * preelaborability of units

   * presence of elaboration-control pragmas

   * invocations performed in elaboration code

A program may have several elaboration orders depending on its
structure.

          package Server is
             function Func (Index : Integer) return Integer;
          end Server;

          package body Server is
             Results : array (1 .. 5) of Integer := (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

             function Func (Index : Integer) return Integer is
             begin
                return Results (Index);
             end Func;
          end Server;

          with Server;
          package Client is
             Val : constant Integer := Server.Func (3);
          end Client;

          with Client;
          procedure Main is begin null; end Main;

The following elaboration order exhibits a fundamental problem referred
to as ‘access-before-elaboration’ or simply ‘ABE’.

          spec of Server
          spec of Client
          body of Server
          body of Main

The elaboration of ‘Server’’s spec materializes function ‘Func’, making
it callable.  The elaboration of ‘Client’’s spec elaborates the
declaration of ‘Val’.  This invokes function ‘Server.Func’, however the
body of ‘Server.Func’ has not been elaborated yet because ‘Server’’s
body comes after ‘Client’’s spec in the elaboration order.  As a result,
the value of constant ‘Val’ is now undefined.

Without any guarantees from the language, an undetected ABE problem may
hinder proper initialization of data, which in turn may lead to
undefined behavior at run time.  To prevent such ABE problems, Ada
employs dynamic checks in the same vein as index or null exclusion
checks.  A failed ABE check raises exception ‘Program_Error’.

The following elaboration order avoids the ABE problem and the program
can be successfully elaborated.

          spec of Server
          body of Server
          spec of Client
          body of Main

Ada states that a total elaboration order must exist, but it does not
define what this order is.  A compiler is thus tasked with choosing a
suitable elaboration order which satisfies the dependencies imposed by
‘with’ clauses, unit categorization, elaboration-control pragmas, and
invocations performed in elaboration code.  Ideally an order that avoids
ABE problems should be chosen, however a compiler may not always find
such an order due to complications with respect to control and data
flow.

9.3 Checking the Elaboration Order
==================================

To avoid placing the entire elaboration-order burden on the programmer,
Ada provides three lines of defense:

   * ‘Static semantics’

     Static semantic rules restrict the possible choice of elaboration
     order.  For instance, if unit Client ‘with’s unit Server, then the
     spec of Server is always elaborated prior to Client.  The same
     principle applies to child units - the spec of a parent unit is
     always elaborated prior to the child unit.

   * ‘Dynamic semantics’

     Dynamic checks are performed at run time, to ensure that a target
     is elaborated prior to a scenario that invokes it, thus avoiding
     ABE problems.  A failed run-time check raises exception
     ‘Program_Error’.  The following restrictions apply:

        - ‘Restrictions on calls’

          An entry, operator, or subprogram can be called from
          elaboration code only when the corresponding body has been
          elaborated.

        - ‘Restrictions on instantiations’

          A generic unit can be instantiated by elaboration code only
          when the corresponding body has been elaborated.

        - ‘Restrictions on task activation’

          A task can be activated by elaboration code only when the body
          of the associated task type has been elaborated.

     The restrictions above can be summarized by the following rule:

     ‘If a target has a body, then this body must be elaborated prior to
     the scenario that invokes the target.’

   * ‘Elaboration control’

     Pragmas are provided for the programmer to specify the desired
     elaboration order.

9.4 Controlling the Elaboration Order in Ada
============================================

Ada provides several idioms and pragmas to aid the programmer with
specifying the desired elaboration order and avoiding ABE problems
altogether.

   * ‘Packages without a body’

     A library package which does not require a completing body does not
     suffer from ABE problems.

          package Pack is
             generic
                type Element is private;
             package Containers is
                type Element_Array is array (1 .. 10) of Element;
             end Containers;
          end Pack;

     In the example above, package ‘Pack’ does not require a body
     because it does not contain any constructs which require completion
     in a body.  As a result, generic ‘Pack.Containers’ can be
     instantiated without encountering any ABE problems.

   * ‘pragma Pure’

     Pragma ‘Pure’ places sufficient restrictions on a unit to guarantee
     that no scenario within the unit can result in an ABE problem.

   * ‘pragma Preelaborate’

     Pragma ‘Preelaborate’ is slightly less restrictive than pragma
     ‘Pure’, but still strong enough to prevent ABE problems within a
     unit.

   * ‘pragma Elaborate_Body’

     Pragma ‘Elaborate_Body’ requires that the body of a unit is
     elaborated immediately after its spec.  This restriction guarantees
     that no client scenario can invoke a server target before the
     target body has been elaborated because the spec and body are
     effectively “glued” together.

          package Server is
             pragma Elaborate_Body;

             function Func return Integer;
          end Server;

          package body Server is
             function Func return Integer is
             begin
                ...
             end Func;
          end Server;

          with Server;
          package Client is
             Val : constant Integer := Server.Func;
          end Client;

     In the example above, pragma ‘Elaborate_Body’ guarantees the
     following elaboration order:

          spec of Server
          body of Server
          spec of Client

     because the spec of ‘Server’ must be elaborated prior to ‘Client’
     by virtue of the ‘with’ clause, and in addition the body of
     ‘Server’ must be elaborated immediately after the spec of ‘Server’.

     Removing pragma ‘Elaborate_Body’ could result in the following
     incorrect elaboration order:

          spec of Server
          spec of Client
          body of Server

     where ‘Client’ invokes ‘Server.Func’, but the body of ‘Server.Func’
     has not been elaborated yet.

The pragmas outlined above allow a server unit to guarantee safe
elaboration use by client units.  Thus it is a good rule to mark units
as ‘Pure’ or ‘Preelaborate’, and if this is not possible, mark them as
‘Elaborate_Body’.

There are however situations where ‘Pure’, ‘Preelaborate’, and
‘Elaborate_Body’ are not applicable.  Ada provides another set of
pragmas for use by client units to help ensure the elaboration safety of
server units they depend on.

   * ‘pragma Elaborate (Unit)’

     Pragma ‘Elaborate’ can be placed in the context clauses of a unit,
     after a ‘with’ clause.  It guarantees that both the spec and body
     of its argument will be elaborated prior to the unit with the
     pragma.  Note that other unrelated units may be elaborated in
     between the spec and the body.

          package Server is
             function Func return Integer;
          end Server;

          package body Server is
             function Func return Integer is
             begin
                ...
             end Func;
          end Server;

          with Server;
          pragma Elaborate (Server);
          package Client is
             Val : constant Integer := Server.Func;
          end Client;

     In the example above, pragma ‘Elaborate’ guarantees the following
     elaboration order:

          spec of Server
          body of Server
          spec of Client

     Removing pragma ‘Elaborate’ could result in the following incorrect
     elaboration order:

          spec of Server
          spec of Client
          body of Server

     where ‘Client’ invokes ‘Server.Func’, but the body of ‘Server.Func’
     has not been elaborated yet.

   * ‘pragma Elaborate_All (Unit)’

     Pragma ‘Elaborate_All’ is placed in the context clauses of a unit,
     after a ‘with’ clause.  It guarantees that both the spec and body
     of its argument will be elaborated prior to the unit with the
     pragma, as well as all units ‘with’ed by the spec and body of the
     argument, recursively.  Note that other unrelated units may be
     elaborated in between the spec and the body.

          package Math is
             function Factorial (Val : Natural) return Natural;
          end Math;

          package body Math is
             function Factorial (Val : Natural) return Natural is
             begin
                ...;
             end Factorial;
          end Math;

          package Computer is
             type Operation_Kind is (None, Op_Factorial);

             function Compute
               (Val : Natural;
                Op  : Operation_Kind) return Natural;
          end Computer;

          with Math;
          package body Computer is
             function Compute
               (Val : Natural;
                Op  : Operation_Kind) return Natural
             is
                if Op = Op_Factorial then
                   return Math.Factorial (Val);
                end if;

                return 0;
             end Compute;
          end Computer;

          with Computer;
          pragma Elaborate_All (Computer);
          package Client is
             Val : constant Natural :=
                     Computer.Compute (123, Computer.Op_Factorial);
          end Client;

     In the example above, pragma ‘Elaborate_All’ can result in the
     following elaboration order:

          spec of Math
          body of Math
          spec of Computer
          body of Computer
          spec of Client

     Note that there are several allowable suborders for the specs and
     bodies of ‘Math’ and ‘Computer’, but the point is that these specs
     and bodies will be elaborated prior to ‘Client’.

     Removing pragma ‘Elaborate_All’ could result in the following
     incorrect elaboration order:

          spec of Math
          spec of Computer
          body of Computer
          spec of Client
          body of Math

     where ‘Client’ invokes ‘Computer.Compute’, which in turn invokes
     ‘Math.Factorial’, but the body of ‘Math.Factorial’ has not been
     elaborated yet.

All pragmas shown above can be summarized by the following rule:

‘If a client unit elaborates a server target directly or indirectly,
then if the server unit requires a body and does not have pragma Pure,
Preelaborate, or Elaborate_Body, then the client unit should have pragma
Elaborate or Elaborate_All for the server unit.’

If the rule outlined above is not followed, then a program may fall in
one of the following states:

   * ‘No elaboration order exists’

     In this case a compiler must diagnose the situation, and refuse to
     build an executable program.

   * ‘One or more incorrect elaboration orders exist’

     In this case a compiler can build an executable program, but
     ‘Program_Error’ will be raised when the program is run.

   * ‘Several elaboration orders exist, some correct, some incorrect’

     In this case the programmer has not controlled the elaboration
     order.  As a result, a compiler may or may not pick one of the
     correct orders, and the program may or may not raise
     ‘Program_Error’ when it is run.  This is the worst possible state
     because the program may fail on another compiler, or even another
     version of the same compiler.

   * ‘One or more correct orders exist’

     In this case a compiler can build an executable program, and the
     program is run successfully.  This state may be guaranteed by
     following the outlined rules, or may be the result of good program
     architecture.

Note that one additional advantage of using ‘Elaborate’ and
‘Elaborate_All’ is that the program continues to stay in the last state
(one or more correct orders exist) even if maintenance changes the
bodies of targets.

9.5 Controlling the Elaboration Order in GNAT
=============================================

In addition to Ada semantics and rules synthesized from them, GNAT
offers three elaboration models to aid the programmer with specifying
the correct elaboration order and to diagnose elaboration problems.

   * ‘Dynamic elaboration model’

     This is the most permissive of the three elaboration models and
     emulates the behavior specified by the Ada Reference Manual.  When
     the dynamic model is in effect, GNAT makes the following
     assumptions:

        - All code within all units in a partition is considered to be
          elaboration code.

        - Some of the invocations in elaboration code may not take place
          at run time due to conditional execution.

     GNAT performs extensive diagnostics on a unit-by-unit basis for all
     scenarios that invoke internal targets.  In addition, GNAT
     generates run-time checks for all external targets and for all
     scenarios that may exhibit ABE problems.

     The elaboration order is obtained by honoring all ‘with’ clauses,
     purity and preelaborability of units, and elaboration-control
     pragmas.  The dynamic model attempts to take all invocations in
     elaboration code into account.  If an invocation leads to a
     circularity, GNAT ignores the invocation based on the assumptions
     stated above.  An order obtained using the dynamic model may fail
     an ABE check at run time when GNAT ignored an invocation.

     The dynamic model is enabled with compiler switch ‘-gnatE’.

   * ‘Static elaboration model’

     This is the middle ground of the three models.  When the static
     model is in effect, GNAT makes the following assumptions:

        - Only code at the library level and in package body statements
          within all units in a partition is considered to be
          elaboration code.

        - All invocations in elaboration will take place at run time,
          regardless of conditional execution.

     GNAT performs extensive diagnostics on a unit-by-unit basis for all
     scenarios that invoke internal targets.  In addition, GNAT
     generates run-time checks for all external targets and for all
     scenarios that may exhibit ABE problems.

     The elaboration order is obtained by honoring all ‘with’ clauses,
     purity and preelaborability of units, presence of
     elaboration-control pragmas, and all invocations in elaboration
     code.  An order obtained using the static model is guaranteed to be
     ABE problem-free, excluding dispatching calls and
     access-to-subprogram types.

     The static model is the default model in GNAT.

   * ‘SPARK elaboration model’

     This is the most conservative of the three models and enforces the
     SPARK rules of elaboration as defined in the SPARK Reference
     Manual, section 7.7.  The SPARK model is in effect only when a
     scenario and a target reside in a region subject to ‘SPARK_Mode
     On’, otherwise the dynamic or static model is in effect.

     The SPARK model is enabled with compiler switch ‘-gnatd.v’.

   * ‘Legacy elaboration models’

     In addition to the three elaboration models outlined above, GNAT
     provides the following legacy models:

        - ‘Legacy elaboration-checking model’ available in pre-18.x
          versions of GNAT. This model is enabled with compiler switch
          ‘-gnatH’.

        - ‘Legacy elaboration-order model’ available in pre-20.x
          versions of GNAT. This model is enabled with binder switch
          ‘-H’.

The dynamic, legacy, and static models can be relaxed using compiler
switch ‘-gnatJ’, making them more permissive.  Note that in this mode,
GNAT may not diagnose certain elaboration issues or install run-time
checks.

9.6 Mixing Elaboration Models
=============================

It is possible to mix units compiled with a different elaboration model,
however the following rules must be observed:

   * A client unit compiled with the dynamic model can only ‘with’ a
     server unit that meets at least one of the following criteria:

        - The server unit is compiled with the dynamic model.

        - The server unit is a GNAT implementation unit from the ‘Ada’,
          ‘GNAT’, ‘Interfaces’, or ‘System’ hierarchies.

        - The server unit has pragma ‘Pure’ or ‘Preelaborate’.

        - The client unit has an explicit ‘Elaborate_All’ pragma for the
          server unit.

These rules ensure that elaboration checks are not omitted.  If the
rules are violated, the binder emits a warning:

          warning: "x.ads" has dynamic elaboration checks and with's
          warning:   "y.ads" which has static elaboration checks

The warnings can be suppressed by binder switch ‘-ws’.

9.7 ABE Diagnostics
===================

GNAT performs extensive diagnostics on a unit-by-unit basis for all
scenarios that invoke internal targets, regardless of whether the
dynamic, SPARK, or static model is in effect.

Note that GNAT emits warnings rather than hard errors whenever it
encounters an elaboration problem.  This is because the elaboration
model in effect may be too conservative, or a particular scenario may
not be invoked due conditional execution.  The warnings can be
suppressed selectively with ‘pragma Warnings (Off)’ or globally with
compiler switch ‘-gnatwL’.

A ‘guaranteed ABE’ arises when the body of a target is not elaborated
early enough, and causes ‘all’ scenarios that directly invoke the target
to fail.

          package body Guaranteed_ABE is
             function ABE return Integer;

             Val : constant Integer := ABE;

             function ABE return Integer is
             begin
               ...
             end ABE;
          end Guaranteed_ABE;

In the example above, the elaboration of ‘Guaranteed_ABE’’s body
elaborates the declaration of ‘Val’.  This invokes function ‘ABE’,
however the body of ‘ABE’ has not been elaborated yet.  GNAT emits the
following diagnostic:

          4.    Val : constant Integer := ABE;
                                          |
             >>> warning: cannot call "ABE" before body seen
             >>> warning: Program_Error will be raised at run time

A ‘conditional ABE’ arises when the body of a target is not elaborated
early enough, and causes ‘some’ scenarios that directly invoke the
target to fail.

           1. package body Conditional_ABE is
           2.    procedure Force_Body is null;
           3.
           4.    generic
           5.       with function Func return Integer;
           6.    package Gen is
           7.       Val : constant Integer := Func;
           8.    end Gen;
           9.
          10.    function ABE return Integer;
          11.
          12.    function Cause_ABE return Boolean is
          13.       package Inst is new Gen (ABE);
          14.    begin
          15.       ...
          16.    end Cause_ABE;
          17.
          18.    Val : constant Boolean := Cause_ABE;
          19.
          20.    function ABE return Integer is
          21.    begin
          22.       ...
          23.    end ABE;
          24.
          25.    Safe : constant Boolean := Cause_ABE;
          26. end Conditional_ABE;

In the example above, the elaboration of package body ‘Conditional_ABE’
elaborates the declaration of ‘Val’.  This invokes function ‘Cause_ABE’,
which instantiates generic unit ‘Gen’ as ‘Inst’.  The elaboration of
‘Inst’ invokes function ‘ABE’, however the body of ‘ABE’ has not been
elaborated yet.  GNAT emits the following diagnostic:

          13.       package Inst is new Gen (ABE);
                    |
              >>> warning: in instantiation at line 7
              >>> warning: cannot call "ABE" before body seen
              >>> warning: Program_Error may be raised at run time
              >>> warning:   body of unit "Conditional_ABE" elaborated
              >>> warning:   function "Cause_ABE" called at line 18
              >>> warning:   function "ABE" called at line 7, instance at line 13

Note that the same ABE problem does not occur with the elaboration of
declaration ‘Safe’ because the body of function ‘ABE’ has already been
elaborated at that point.

9.8 SPARK Diagnostics
=====================

GNAT enforces the SPARK rules of elaboration as defined in the SPARK
Reference Manual section 7.7 when compiler switch ‘-gnatd.v’ is in
effect.  Note that GNAT emits hard errors whenever it encounters a
violation of the SPARK rules.

          1. with Server;
          2. package body SPARK_Diagnostics with SPARK_Mode is
          3.    Val : constant Integer := Server.Func;
                                                |
             >>> call to "Func" during elaboration in SPARK
             >>> unit "SPARK_Diagnostics" requires pragma "Elaborate_All" for "Server"
             >>>   body of unit "SPARK_Model" elaborated
             >>>   function "Func" called at line 3

          4. end SPARK_Diagnostics;


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: Elaboration Circularities,  Next: Resolving Elaboration Circularities,  Prev: SPARK Diagnostics,  Up: Elaboration Order Handling in GNAT

9.9 Elaboration Circularities
=============================

An ‘elaboration circularity’ occurs whenever the elaboration of a set of
units enters a deadlocked state, where each unit is waiting for another
unit to be elaborated.  This situation may be the result of improper use
of ‘with’ clauses, elaboration-control pragmas, or invocations in
elaboration code.

The following example exhibits an elaboration circularity.

          with B; pragma Elaborate (B);
          package A is
          end A;

          package B is
             procedure Force_Body;
          end B;

          with C;
          package body B is
             procedure Force_Body is null;

             Elab : constant Integer := C.Func;
          end B;

          package C is
             function Func return Integer;
          end C;

          with A;
          package body C is
             function Func return Integer is
             begin
                ...
             end Func;
          end C;

The binder emits the following diagnostic:

          error: Elaboration circularity detected
          info:
          info:    Reason:
          info:
          info:      unit "a (spec)" depends on its own elaboration
          info:
          info:    Circularity:
          info:

          info:      unit "b (body)" is in the closure of pragma Elaborate
          info:      unit "b (body)" invokes a construct of unit "c (body)" at elaboration time
          info:      unit "c (body)" has with clause for unit "a (spec)"
          info:
          info:    Suggestions:

          info:      use the dynamic elaboration model (compiler switch -gnatE)

The diagnostic consist of the following sections:

   * Reason

     This section provides a short explanation describing why the set of
     units could not be ordered.

   * Circularity

     This section enumerates the units comprising the deadlocked set,
     along with their interdependencies.

   * Suggestions

     This section enumerates various tactics for eliminating the
     circularity.

9.10 Resolving Elaboration Circularities
========================================

The most desirable option from the point of view of long-term
maintenance is to rearrange the program so that the elaboration problems
are avoided.  One useful technique is to place the elaboration code into
separate child packages.  Another is to move some of the initialization
code to explicitly invoked subprograms, where the program controls the
order of initialization explicitly.  Although this is the most desirable
option, it may be impractical and involve too much modification,
especially in the case of complex legacy code.

When faced with an elaboration circularity, the programmer should also
consider the tactics given in the suggestions section of the circularity
diagnostic.  Depending on the units involved in the circularity, their
‘with’ clauses, purity, preelaborability, presence of
elaboration-control pragmas and invocations at elaboration time, the
binder may suggest one or more of the following tactics to eliminate the
circularity:

   * Pragma Elaborate elimination

          remove pragma Elaborate for unit "..." in unit "..."

     This tactic is suggested when the binder has determined that pragma
     ‘Elaborate’:

        - Prevents a set of units from being elaborated.

        - The removal of the pragma will not eliminate the semantic
          effects of the pragma.  In other words, the argument of the
          pragma will still be elaborated prior to the unit containing
          the pragma.

        - The removal of the pragma will enable the successful ordering
          of the units.

     The programmer should remove the pragma as advised, and rebuild the
     program.

   * Pragma Elaborate_All elimination

          remove pragma Elaborate_All for unit "..." in unit "..."

     This tactic is suggested when the binder has determined that pragma
     ‘Elaborate_All’:

        - Prevents a set of units from being elaborated.

        - The removal of the pragma will not eliminate the semantic
          effects of the pragma.  In other words, the argument of the
          pragma along with its ‘with’ closure will still be elaborated
          prior to the unit containing the pragma.

        - The removal of the pragma will enable the successful ordering
          of the units.

     The programmer should remove the pragma as advised, and rebuild the
     program.

   * Pragma Elaborate_All downgrade

          change pragma Elaborate_All for unit "..." to Elaborate in unit "..."

     This tactic is always suggested with the pragma ‘Elaborate_All’
     elimination tactic.  It offers a different alternative of
     guaranteeing that the argument of the pragma will still be
     elaborated prior to the unit containing the pragma.

     The programmer should update the pragma as advised, and rebuild the
     program.

   * Pragma Elaborate_Body elimination

          remove pragma Elaborate_Body in unit "..."

     This tactic is suggested when the binder has determined that pragma
     ‘Elaborate_Body’:

        - Prevents a set of units from being elaborated.

        - The removal of the pragma will enable the successful ordering
          of the units.

     Note that the binder cannot determine whether the pragma is
     required for other purposes, such as guaranteeing the
     initialization of a variable declared in the spec by elaboration
     code in the body.

     The programmer should remove the pragma as advised, and rebuild the
     program.

   * Use of pragma Restrictions

          use pragma Restrictions (No_Entry_Calls_In_Elaboration_Code)

     This tactic is suggested when the binder has determined that a task
     activation at elaboration time:

        - Prevents a set of units from being elaborated.

     Note that the binder cannot determine with certainty whether the
     task will block at elaboration time.

     The programmer should create a configuration file, place the pragma
     within, update the general compilation arguments, and rebuild the
     program.

   * Use of dynamic elaboration model

          use the dynamic elaboration model (compiler switch -gnatE)

     This tactic is suggested when the binder has determined that an
     invocation at elaboration time:

        - Prevents a set of units from being elaborated.

        - The use of the dynamic model will enable the successful
          ordering of the units.

     The programmer has two options:

        - Determine the units involved in the invocation using the
          detailed invocation information, and add compiler switch
          ‘-gnatE’ to the compilation arguments of selected files only.
          This approach will yield safer elaboration orders compared to
          the other option because it will minimize the opportunities
          presented to the dynamic model for ignoring invocations.

        - Add compiler switch ‘-gnatE’ to the general compilation
          arguments.

   * Use of detailed invocation information

          use detailed invocation information (compiler switch -gnatd_F)

     This tactic is always suggested with the use of the dynamic model
     tactic.  It causes the circularity section of the circularity
     diagnostic to describe the flow of elaboration code from a unit to
     a unit, enumerating all such paths in the process.

     The programmer should analyze this information to determine which
     units should be compiled with the dynamic model.

   * Forced-dependency elimination

          remove the dependency of unit "..." on unit "..." from the argument of switch -f

     This tactic is suggested when the binder has determined that a
     dependency present in the forced-elaboration-order file indicated
     by binder switch ‘-f’:

        - Prevents a set of units from being elaborated.

        - The removal of the dependency will enable the successful
          ordering of the units.

     The programmer should edit the forced-elaboration-order file,
     remove the dependency, and rebind the program.

   * All forced-dependency elimination

          remove switch -f

     This tactic is suggested in case editing the
     forced-elaboration-order file is not an option.

     The programmer should remove binder switch ‘-f’ from the binder
     arguments, and rebind.

   * Multiple-circularities diagnostic

          diagnose all circularities (binder switch -d_C)

     By default, the binder will diagnose only the highest-precedence
     circularity.  If the program contains multiple circularities, the
     binder will suggest the use of binder switch ‘-d_C’ in order to
     obtain the diagnostics of all circularities.

     The programmer should add binder switch ‘-d_C’ to the binder
     arguments, and rebind.

If none of the tactics suggested by the binder eliminate the elaboration
circularity, the programmer should consider using one of the legacy
elaboration models, in the following order:

   * Use the pre-20.x legacy elaboration-order model, with binder switch
     ‘-H’.

   * Use both pre-18.x and pre-20.x legacy elaboration models, with
     compiler switch ‘-gnatH’ and binder switch ‘-H’.

   * Use the relaxed static-elaboration model, with compiler switches
     ‘-gnatH’ ‘-gnatJ’ and binder switch ‘-H’.

   * Use the relaxed dynamic-elaboration model, with compiler switches
     ‘-gnatH’ ‘-gnatJ’ ‘-gnatE’ and binder switch ‘-H’.

9.11 Elaboration-related Compiler Switches
==========================================

GNAT has several switches that affect the elaboration model and
consequently the elaboration order chosen by the binder.

‘-gnatE’

     Dynamic elaboration checking mode enabled

     When this switch is in effect, GNAT activates the dynamic model.

‘-gnatel’

     Turn on info messages on generated Elaborate[_All] pragmas

     This switch is only applicable to the pre-20.x legacy elaboration
     models.  The post-20.x elaboration model no longer relies on
     implicitly generated ‘Elaborate’ and ‘Elaborate_All’ pragmas to
     order units.

     When this switch is in effect, GNAT will emit the following
     supplementary information depending on the elaboration model in
     effect.

        - ‘Dynamic model’

          GNAT will indicate missing ‘Elaborate’ and ‘Elaborate_All’
          pragmas for all library-level scenarios within the partition.

        - ‘Static model’

          GNAT will indicate all scenarios invoked during elaboration.
          In addition, it will provide detailed traceback when an
          implicit ‘Elaborate’ or ‘Elaborate_All’ pragma is generated.

        - ‘SPARK model’

          GNAT will indicate how an elaboration requirement is met by
          the context of a unit.  This diagnostic requires compiler
          switch ‘-gnatd.v’.

               1. with Server; pragma Elaborate_All (Server);
               2. package Client with SPARK_Mode is
               3.    Val : constant Integer := Server.Func;
                                                     |
                  >>> info: call to "Func" during elaboration in SPARK
                  >>> info: "Elaborate_All" requirement for unit "Server" met by pragma at line 1

               4. end Client;

‘-gnatH’

     Legacy elaboration checking mode enabled

     When this switch is in effect, GNAT will utilize the pre-18.x
     elaboration model.

‘-gnatJ’

     Relaxed elaboration checking mode enabled

     When this switch is in effect, GNAT will not process certain
     scenarios, resulting in a more permissive elaboration model.  Note
     that this may eliminate some diagnostics and run-time checks.

‘-gnatw.f’

     Turn on warnings for suspicious Subp’Access

     When this switch is in effect, GNAT will treat ‘'Access’ of an
     entry, operator, or subprogram as a potential call to the target
     and issue warnings:

           1. package body Attribute_Call is
           2.    function Func return Integer;
           3.    type Func_Ptr is access function return Integer;
           4.
           5.    Ptr : constant Func_Ptr := Func'Access;
                                                |
              >>> warning: "Access" attribute of "Func" before body seen
              >>> warning: possible Program_Error on later references
              >>> warning:   body of unit "Attribute_Call" elaborated
              >>> warning:   "Access" of "Func" taken at line 5

           6.
           7.    function Func return Integer is
           8.    begin
           9.       ...
          10.    end Func;
          11. end Attribute_Call;

     In the example above, the elaboration of declaration ‘Ptr’ is
     assigned ‘Func'Access’ before the body of ‘Func’ has been
     elaborated.

‘-gnatwl’

     Turn on warnings for elaboration problems

     When this switch is in effect, GNAT emits diagnostics in the form
     of warnings concerning various elaboration problems.  The warnings
     are enabled by default.  The switch is provided in case all
     warnings are suppressed, but elaboration warnings are still
     desired.

‘-gnatwL’

     Turn off warnings for elaboration problems

     When this switch is in effect, GNAT no longer emits any diagnostics
     in the form of warnings.  Selective suppression of elaboration
     problems is possible using ‘pragma Warnings (Off)’.

           1. package body Selective_Suppression is
           2.    function ABE return Integer;
           3.
           4.    Val_1 : constant Integer := ABE;
                                             |
              >>> warning: cannot call "ABE" before body seen
              >>> warning: Program_Error will be raised at run time

           5.
           6.    pragma Warnings (Off);
           7.    Val_2 : constant Integer := ABE;
           8.    pragma Warnings (On);
           9.
          10.    function ABE return Integer is
          11.    begin
          12.       ...
          13.    end ABE;
          14. end Selective_Suppression;

     Note that suppressing elaboration warnings does not eliminate
     run-time checks.  The example above will still fail at run time
     with an ABE.

9.12 Summary of Procedures for Elaboration Control
==================================================

A programmer should first compile the program with the default options,
using none of the binder or compiler switches.  If the binder succeeds
in finding an elaboration order, then apart from possible cases
involving dispatching calls and access-to-subprogram types, the program
is free of elaboration errors.

If it is important for the program to be portable to compilers other
than GNAT, then the programmer should use compiler switch ‘-gnatel’ and
consider the messages about missing or implicitly created ‘Elaborate’
and ‘Elaborate_All’ pragmas.

If the binder reports an elaboration circularity, the programmer has
several options:

   * Ensure that elaboration warnings are enabled.  This will allow the
     static model to output trace information of elaboration issues.
     The trace information could shed light on previously unforeseen
     dependencies, as well as their origins.  Elaboration warnings are
     enabled with compiler switch ‘-gnatwl’.

   * Cosider the tactics given in the suggestions section of the
     circularity diagnostic.

   * If none of the steps outlined above resolve the circularity, use a
     more permissive elaboration model, in the following order:

        - Use the pre-20.x legacy elaboration-order model, with binder
          switch ‘-H’.

        - Use both pre-18.x and pre-20.x legacy elaboration models, with
          compiler switch ‘-gnatH’ and binder switch ‘-H’.

        - Use the relaxed static elaboration model, with compiler
          switches ‘-gnatH’ ‘-gnatJ’ and binder switch ‘-H’.

        - Use the relaxed dynamic elaboration model, with compiler
          switches ‘-gnatH’ ‘-gnatJ’ ‘-gnatE’ and binder switch ‘-H’.

9.13 Inspecting the Chosen Elaboration Order
============================================

To see the elaboration order chosen by the binder, inspect the contents
of file ‘b~xxx.adb’.  On certain targets, this file appears as
‘b_xxx.adb’.  The elaboration order appears as a sequence of calls to
‘Elab_Body’ and ‘Elab_Spec’, interspersed with assignments to ‘Exxx’
which indicates that a particular unit is elaborated.  For example:

          System.Soft_Links'Elab_Body;
          E14 := True;
          System.Secondary_Stack'Elab_Body;
          E18 := True;
          System.Exception_Table'Elab_Body;
          E24 := True;
          Ada.Io_Exceptions'Elab_Spec;
          E67 := True;
          Ada.Tags'Elab_Spec;
          Ada.Streams'Elab_Spec;
          E43 := True;
          Interfaces.C'Elab_Spec;
          E69 := True;
          System.Finalization_Root'Elab_Spec;
          E60 := True;
          System.Os_Lib'Elab_Body;
          E71 := True;
          System.Finalization_Implementation'Elab_Spec;
          System.Finalization_Implementation'Elab_Body;
          E62 := True;
          Ada.Finalization'Elab_Spec;
          E58 := True;
          Ada.Finalization.List_Controller'Elab_Spec;
          E76 := True;
          System.File_Control_Block'Elab_Spec;
          E74 := True;
          System.File_Io'Elab_Body;
          E56 := True;
          Ada.Tags'Elab_Body;
          E45 := True;
          Ada.Text_Io'Elab_Spec;
          Ada.Text_Io'Elab_Body;
          E07 := True;

Note also binder switch ‘-l’, which outputs the chosen elaboration order

10 Inline Assembler
*******************

If you need to write low-level software that interacts directly with the
hardware, Ada provides two ways to incorporate assembly language code
into your program.  First, you can import and invoke external routines
written in assembly language, an Ada feature fully supported by GNAT.
However, for small sections of code it may be simpler or more efficient
to include assembly language statements directly in your Ada source
program, using the facilities of the implementation-defined package
‘System.Machine_Code’, which incorporates the gcc Inline Assembler.  The
Inline Assembler approach offers a number of advantages, including the
following:

   * No need to use non-Ada tools

   * Consistent interface over different targets

   * Automatic usage of the proper calling conventions

   * Access to Ada constants and variables

   * Definition of intrinsic routines

   * Possibility of inlining a subprogram comprising assembler code

   * Code optimizer can take Inline Assembler code into account

This appendix presents a series of examples to show you how to use the
Inline Assembler.  Although it focuses on the Intel x86, the general
approach applies also to other processors.  It is assumed that you are
familiar with Ada and with assembly language programming.

10.1 Basic Assembler Syntax
===========================

The assembler used by GNAT and gcc is based not on the Intel assembly
language, but rather on a language that descends from the AT&T Unix
assembler ‘as’ (and which is often referred to as ‘AT&T syntax’).  The
following table summarizes the main features of ‘as’ syntax and points
out the differences from the Intel conventions.  See the gcc ‘as’ and
‘gas’ (an ‘as’ macro pre-processor) documentation for further
information.

     ‘Register names’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: Prefix with ‘%’; for example ‘%eax’ 
          Intel: No extra punctuation; for example ‘eax’ 

     ‘Immediate operand’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: Prefix with ‘$’; for example ‘$4’ 
          Intel: No extra punctuation; for example ‘4’ 

     ‘Address’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: Prefix with ‘$’; for example ‘$loc’ 
          Intel: No extra punctuation; for example ‘loc’ 

     ‘Memory contents’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: No extra punctuation; for example ‘loc’ 
          Intel: Square brackets; for example ‘[loc]’ 

     ‘Register contents’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: Parentheses; for example ‘(%eax)’ 
          Intel: Square brackets; for example ‘[eax]’ 

     ‘Hexadecimal numbers’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: Leading ‘0x’ (C language syntax); for example ‘0xA0’ 
          Intel: Trailing ‘h’; for example ‘A0h’ 

     ‘Operand size’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: Explicit in op code; for example ‘movw’ to move a 16-bit word 
          Intel: Implicit, deduced by assembler; for example ‘mov’ 

     ‘Instruction repetition’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: Split into two lines; for example 
               ‘rep’ 
               ‘stosl’ 
          Intel: Keep on one line; for example ‘rep stosl’ 

     ‘Order of operands’ 
          gcc / ‘as’: Source first; for example ‘movw $4, %eax’ 
          Intel: Destination first; for example ‘mov eax, 4’

10.2 A Simple Example of Inline Assembler
=========================================

The following example will generate a single assembly language
statement, ‘nop’, which does nothing.  Despite its lack of run-time
effect, the example will be useful in illustrating the basics of the
Inline Assembler facility.

          with System.Machine_Code; use System.Machine_Code;
          procedure Nothing is
          begin
             Asm ("nop");
          end Nothing;

‘Asm’ is a procedure declared in package ‘System.Machine_Code’; here it
takes one parameter, a ‘template string’ that must be a static
expression and that will form the generated instruction.  ‘Asm’ may be
regarded as a compile-time procedure that parses the template string and
additional parameters (none here), from which it generates a sequence of
assembly language instructions.

The examples in this chapter will illustrate several of the forms for
invoking ‘Asm’; a complete specification of the syntax is found in the
‘Machine_Code_Insertions’ section of the ‘GNAT Reference Manual’.

Under the standard GNAT conventions, the ‘Nothing’ procedure should be
in a file named ‘nothing.adb’.  You can build the executable in the
usual way:

          $ gnatmake nothing

However, the interesting aspect of this example is not its run-time
behavior but rather the generated assembly code.  To see this output,
invoke the compiler as follows:

          $ gcc -c -S -fomit-frame-pointer -gnatp nothing.adb

where the options are:

   * 
     ‘-c’

          compile only (no bind or link)

   * 
     ‘-S’

          generate assembler listing

   * 
     ‘-fomit-frame-pointer’

          do not set up separate stack frames

   * 
     ‘-gnatp’

          do not add runtime checks

This gives a human-readable assembler version of the code.  The
resulting file will have the same name as the Ada source file, but with
a ‘.s’ extension.  In our example, the file ‘nothing.s’ has the
following contents:

          .file "nothing.adb"
          gcc2_compiled.:
          ___gnu_compiled_ada:
          .text
             .align 4
          .globl __ada_nothing
          __ada_nothing:
          #APP
             nop
          #NO_APP
             jmp L1
             .align 2,0x90
          L1:
             ret

The assembly code you included is clearly indicated by the compiler,
between the ‘#APP’ and ‘#NO_APP’ delimiters.  The character before the
‘APP’ and ‘NOAPP’ can differ on different targets.  For example,
GNU/Linux uses ‘#APP’ while on NT you will see ‘/APP’.

If you make a mistake in your assembler code (such as using the wrong
size modifier, or using a wrong operand for the instruction) GNAT will
report this error in a temporary file, which will be deleted when the
compilation is finished.  Generating an assembler file will help in such
cases, since you can assemble this file separately using the ‘as’
assembler that comes with gcc.

Assembling the file using the command

          $ as nothing.s

will give you error messages whose lines correspond to the assembler
input file, so you can easily find and correct any mistakes you made.
If there are no errors, ‘as’ will generate an object file ‘nothing.out’.

10.3 Output Variables in Inline Assembler
=========================================

The examples in this section, showing how to access the processor flags,
illustrate how to specify the destination operands for assembly language
statements.

          with Interfaces; use Interfaces;
          with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
          with System.Machine_Code; use System.Machine_Code;
          procedure Get_Flags is
             Flags : Unsigned_32;
             use ASCII;
          begin
             Asm ("pushfl"          & LF & HT & -- push flags on stack
                  "popl %%eax"      & LF & HT & -- load eax with flags
                  "movl %%eax, %0",             -- store flags in variable
                  Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Flags));
             Put_Line ("Flags register:" & Flags'Img);
          end Get_Flags;

In order to have a nicely aligned assembly listing, we have separated
multiple assembler statements in the Asm template string with linefeed
(ASCII.LF) and horizontal tab (ASCII.HT) characters.  The resulting
section of the assembly output file is:

          #APP
             pushfl
             popl %eax
             movl %eax, -40(%ebp)
          #NO_APP

It would have been legal to write the Asm invocation as:

          Asm ("pushfl popl %%eax movl %%eax, %0")

but in the generated assembler file, this would come out as:

          #APP
             pushfl popl %eax movl %eax, -40(%ebp)
          #NO_APP

which is not so convenient for the human reader.

We use Ada comments at the end of each line to explain what the
assembler instructions actually do.  This is a useful convention.

When writing Inline Assembler instructions, you need to precede each
register and variable name with a percent sign.  Since the assembler
already requires a percent sign at the beginning of a register name, you
need two consecutive percent signs for such names in the Asm template
string, thus ‘%%eax’.  In the generated assembly code, one of the
percent signs will be stripped off.

Names such as ‘%0’, ‘%1’, ‘%2’, etc., denote input or output variables:
operands you later define using ‘Input’ or ‘Output’ parameters to ‘Asm’.
An output variable is illustrated in the third statement in the Asm
template string:

          movl %%eax, %0

The intent is to store the contents of the eax register in a variable
that can be accessed in Ada.  Simply writing ‘movl %%eax, Flags’ would
not necessarily work, since the compiler might optimize by using a
register to hold Flags, and the expansion of the ‘movl’ instruction
would not be aware of this optimization.  The solution is not to store
the result directly but rather to advise the compiler to choose the
correct operand form; that is the purpose of the ‘%0’ output variable.

Information about the output variable is supplied in the ‘Outputs’
parameter to ‘Asm’:

          Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Flags));

The output is defined by the ‘Asm_Output’ attribute of the target type;
the general format is

          Type'Asm_Output (constraint_string, variable_name)

The constraint string directs the compiler how to store/access the
associated variable.  In the example

          Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=m", Flags);

the ‘"m"’ (memory) constraint tells the compiler that the variable
‘Flags’ should be stored in a memory variable, thus preventing the
optimizer from keeping it in a register.  In contrast,

          Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=r", Flags);

uses the ‘"r"’ (register) constraint, telling the compiler to store the
variable in a register.

If the constraint is preceded by the equal character ‘=’, it tells the
compiler that the variable will be used to store data into it.

In the ‘Get_Flags’ example, we used the ‘"g"’ (global) constraint,
allowing the optimizer to choose whatever it deems best.

There are a fairly large number of constraints, but the ones that are
most useful (for the Intel x86 processor) are the following:

     ‘=’        output constraint
                
                
     ‘g’        global (i.e., can be stored anywhere)
                
                
     ‘m’        in memory
                
                
     ‘I’        a constant
                
                
     ‘a’        use eax
                
                
     ‘b’        use ebx
                
                
     ‘c’        use ecx
                
                
     ‘d’        use edx
                
                
     ‘S’        use esi
                
                
     ‘D’        use edi
                
                
     ‘r’        use one of eax, ebx, ecx or edx
                
                
     ‘q’        use one of eax, ebx, ecx, edx, esi or edi
                

The full set of constraints is described in the gcc and ‘as’
documentation; note that it is possible to combine certain constraints
in one constraint string.

You specify the association of an output variable with an assembler
operand through the ‘%N’ notation, where ‘n’ is a non-negative integer.
Thus in

          Asm ("pushfl"          & LF & HT & -- push flags on stack
               "popl %%eax"      & LF & HT & -- load eax with flags
               "movl %%eax, %0",             -- store flags in variable
               Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Flags));

‘%0’ will be replaced in the expanded code by the appropriate operand,
whatever the compiler decided for the ‘Flags’ variable.

In general, you may have any number of output variables:

   * Count the operands starting at 0; thus ‘%0’, ‘%1’, etc.

   * Specify the ‘Outputs’ parameter as a parenthesized comma-separated
     list of ‘Asm_Output’ attributes

For example:

          Asm ("movl %%eax, %0" & LF & HT &
               "movl %%ebx, %1" & LF & HT &
               "movl %%ecx, %2",
               Outputs => (Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Var_A),   --  %0 = Var_A
                           Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Var_B),   --  %1 = Var_B
                           Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Var_C))); --  %2 = Var_C

where ‘Var_A’, ‘Var_B’, and ‘Var_C’ are variables in the Ada program.

As a variation on the ‘Get_Flags’ example, we can use the constraints
string to direct the compiler to store the eax register into the ‘Flags’
variable, instead of including the store instruction explicitly in the
‘Asm’ template string:

          with Interfaces; use Interfaces;
          with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
          with System.Machine_Code; use System.Machine_Code;
          procedure Get_Flags_2 is
             Flags : Unsigned_32;
             use ASCII;
          begin
             Asm ("pushfl"      & LF & HT & -- push flags on stack
                  "popl %%eax",             -- save flags in eax
                  Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=a", Flags));
             Put_Line ("Flags register:" & Flags'Img);
          end Get_Flags_2;

The ‘"a"’ constraint tells the compiler that the ‘Flags’ variable will
come from the eax register.  Here is the resulting code:

          #APP
             pushfl
             popl %eax
          #NO_APP
             movl %eax,-40(%ebp)

The compiler generated the store of eax into Flags after expanding the
assembler code.

Actually, there was no need to pop the flags into the eax register; more
simply, we could just pop the flags directly into the program variable:

          with Interfaces; use Interfaces;
          with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
          with System.Machine_Code; use System.Machine_Code;
          procedure Get_Flags_3 is
             Flags : Unsigned_32;
             use ASCII;
          begin
             Asm ("pushfl"  & LF & HT & -- push flags on stack
                  "pop %0",             -- save flags in Flags
                  Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Flags));
             Put_Line ("Flags register:" & Flags'Img);
          end Get_Flags_3;

10.4 Input Variables in Inline Assembler
========================================

The example in this section illustrates how to specify the source
operands for assembly language statements.  The program simply
increments its input value by 1:

          with Interfaces; use Interfaces;
          with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
          with System.Machine_Code; use System.Machine_Code;
          procedure Increment is

             function Incr (Value : Unsigned_32) return Unsigned_32 is
                Result : Unsigned_32;
             begin
                Asm ("incl %0",
                     Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=a", Result),
                     Inputs  => Unsigned_32'Asm_Input ("a", Value));
                return Result;
             end Incr;

             Value : Unsigned_32;

          begin
             Value := 5;
             Put_Line ("Value before is" & Value'Img);
             Value := Incr (Value);
            Put_Line ("Value after is" & Value'Img);
          end Increment;

The ‘Outputs’ parameter to ‘Asm’ specifies that the result will be in
the eax register and that it is to be stored in the ‘Result’ variable.

The ‘Inputs’ parameter looks much like the ‘Outputs’ parameter, but with
an ‘Asm_Input’ attribute.  The ‘"="’ constraint, indicating an output
value, is not present.

You can have multiple input variables, in the same way that you can have
more than one output variable.

The parameter count (%0, %1) etc, still starts at the first output
statement, and continues with the input statements.

Just as the ‘Outputs’ parameter causes the register to be stored into
the target variable after execution of the assembler statements, so does
the ‘Inputs’ parameter cause its variable to be loaded into the register
before execution of the assembler statements.

Thus the effect of the ‘Asm’ invocation is:

   * load the 32-bit value of ‘Value’ into eax

   * execute the ‘incl %eax’ instruction

   * store the contents of eax into the ‘Result’ variable

The resulting assembler file (with ‘-O2’ optimization) contains:

          _increment__incr.1:
             subl $4,%esp
             movl 8(%esp),%eax
          #APP
             incl %eax
          #NO_APP
             movl %eax,%edx
             movl %ecx,(%esp)
             addl $4,%esp
             ret

10.5 Inlining Inline Assembler Code
===================================

For a short subprogram such as the ‘Incr’ function in the previous
section, the overhead of the call and return (creating / deleting the
stack frame) can be significant, compared to the amount of code in the
subprogram body.  A solution is to apply Ada’s ‘Inline’ pragma to the
subprogram, which directs the compiler to expand invocations of the
subprogram at the point(s) of call, instead of setting up a stack frame
for out-of-line calls.  Here is the resulting program:

          with Interfaces; use Interfaces;
          with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
          with System.Machine_Code; use System.Machine_Code;
          procedure Increment_2 is

             function Incr (Value : Unsigned_32) return Unsigned_32 is
                Result : Unsigned_32;
             begin
                Asm ("incl %0",
                     Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=a", Result),
                     Inputs  => Unsigned_32'Asm_Input ("a", Value));
                return Result;
             end Incr;
             pragma Inline (Increment);

             Value : Unsigned_32;

          begin
             Value := 5;
             Put_Line ("Value before is" & Value'Img);
             Value := Increment (Value);
             Put_Line ("Value after is" & Value'Img);
          end Increment_2;

Compile the program with both optimization (‘-O2’) and inlining
(‘-gnatn’) enabled.

The ‘Incr’ function is still compiled as usual, but at the point in
‘Increment’ where our function used to be called:

          pushl %edi
          call _increment__incr.1

the code for the function body directly appears:

          movl %esi,%eax
          #APP
             incl %eax
          #NO_APP
             movl %eax,%edx

thus saving the overhead of stack frame setup and an out-of-line call.

10.6 Other ‘Asm’ Functionality
==============================

This section describes two important parameters to the ‘Asm’ procedure:
‘Clobber’, which identifies register usage; and ‘Volatile’, which
inhibits unwanted optimizations.

* Menu:

* The Clobber Parameter::
* The Volatile Parameter::


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: The Clobber Parameter,  Next: The Volatile Parameter,  Up: Other Asm Functionality

10.6.1 The ‘Clobber’ Parameter
------------------------------

One of the dangers of intermixing assembly language and a compiled
language such as Ada is that the compiler needs to be aware of which
registers are being used by the assembly code.  In some cases, such as
the earlier examples, the constraint string is sufficient to indicate
register usage (e.g., ‘"a"’ for the eax register).  But more generally,
the compiler needs an explicit identification of the registers that are
used by the Inline Assembly statements.

Using a register that the compiler doesn’t know about could be a side
effect of an instruction (like ‘mull’ storing its result in both eax and
edx).  It can also arise from explicit register usage in your assembly
code; for example:

          Asm ("movl %0, %%ebx" & LF & HT &
               "movl %%ebx, %1",
               Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Var_Out),
               Inputs  => Unsigned_32'Asm_Input  ("g", Var_In));

where the compiler (since it does not analyze the ‘Asm’ template string)
does not know you are using the ebx register.

In such cases you need to supply the ‘Clobber’ parameter to ‘Asm’, to
identify the registers that will be used by your assembly code:

          Asm ("movl %0, %%ebx" & LF & HT &
               "movl %%ebx, %1",
               Outputs => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Var_Out),
               Inputs  => Unsigned_32'Asm_Input  ("g", Var_In),
               Clobber => "ebx");

The Clobber parameter is a static string expression specifying the
register(s) you are using.  Note that register names are ‘not’ prefixed
by a percent sign.  Also, if more than one register is used then their
names are separated by commas; e.g., ‘"eax, ebx"’

The ‘Clobber’ parameter has several additional uses:

   * Use ‘register’ name ‘cc’ to indicate that flags might have changed

   * Use ‘register’ name ‘memory’ if you changed a memory location


File: gnat_ugn.info,  Node: The Volatile Parameter,  Prev: The Clobber Parameter,  Up: Other Asm Functionality

10.6.2 The ‘Volatile’ Parameter
-------------------------------

Compiler optimizations in the presence of Inline Assembler may sometimes
have unwanted effects.  For example, when an ‘Asm’ invocation with an
input variable is inside a loop, the compiler might move the loading of
the input variable outside the loop, regarding it as a one-time
initialization.

If this effect is not desired, you can disable such optimizations by
setting the ‘Volatile’ parameter to ‘True’; for example:

          Asm ("movl %0, %%ebx" & LF & HT &
               "movl %%ebx, %1",
               Outputs  => Unsigned_32'Asm_Output ("=g", Var_Out),
               Inputs   => Unsigned_32'Asm_Input  ("g", Var_In),
               Clobber  => "ebx",
               Volatile => True);

By default, ‘Volatile’ is set to ‘False’ unless there is no ‘Outputs’
parameter.

Although setting ‘Volatile’ to ‘True’ prevents unwanted optimizations,
it will also disable other optimizations that might be important for
efficiency.  In general, you should set ‘Volatile’ to ‘True’ only if the
compiler’s optimizations have created problems.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

‘Preamble’

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
published as a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for
works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

‘1.  APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS’

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The ‘Document’, below, refers
to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and
is addressed as “‘you’”.  You accept the license if you copy, modify or
distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A “‘Modified Version’” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A “‘Secondary Section’” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The “‘Invariant Sections’” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
says that the Document is released under this License.  If a section
does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero Invariant
Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
there are none.

The “‘Cover Texts’” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may be
at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A “‘Transparent’” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy
that is not “Transparent” is called ‘Opaque’.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The “‘Title Page’” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.

The “‘publisher’” means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section “‘Entitled XYZ’” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “‘Acknowledgements’”,
“‘Dedications’”, “‘Endorsements’”, or “‘History’”.)  To “‘Preserve the
Title’” of such a section when you modify the Document means that it
remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.

‘2.  VERBATIM COPYING’

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

‘3.  COPYING IN QUANTITY’

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

‘4.  MODIFICATIONS’

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
     from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
     (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
     of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
     if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
     responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
     Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
     the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than
     five), unless they release you from this requirement.

  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
     Version, as the publisher.

  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
     to the other copyright notices.

  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
     giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
     terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

  G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license
     notice.

  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

  I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and
     add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
     and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create
     one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document
     as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
     Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
     public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
     the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
     it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section.
     You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
     least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
     publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

  K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
     Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
     the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.

  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
     their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent
     are not considered part of the section titles.

  M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section may not
     be included in the Modified Version.

  N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements”
     or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

  O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.  These
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover
Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text
for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

‘5.  COMBINING DOCUMENTS’

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.  Make the
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”;
likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any
sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all sections Entitled
“Endorsements”.

‘6.  COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS’

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

‘7.  AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS’

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.  When the
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works
of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.  Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

‘8.  TRANSLATION’

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.  Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
Invariant Sections.  You may include a translation of this License, and
all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
provided that you also include the original English version of this
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In
case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

‘9.  TERMINATION’

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

‘10.  FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE’

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
‘https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/’.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be
used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

‘11.  RELICENSING’

“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World
Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides
prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A public wiki
that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A “Massive
Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any
set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

‘ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents’

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

     Copyright © YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant
     Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy of
     the license is included in the section entitled “GNU Free
     Documentation License”.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with … Texts.” line with this:

     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
     LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
