.Dt GETNAMEINFO 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getnameinfo
.Nd resolve IP addresses and ports to host and service names
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46rufnNHS
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Ar IP-address
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility resolves IP addresses and port numbers to hostnames and service names
as if with the
.Xr getnameinfo 3
library routine and formats them to standard output.
.Pp
The output is a single line of space-separated fields:
.Pp
.Dl hostname service
.Pp
Depending on the flags specified, the output may consist only of the hostname
or service name, or their numeric representations.
By default, both are shown.
.Pp
Although
.Nm
may query the DNS or other sources for name resolution depending on the
system's
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5
configuration, it is not intended to replace DNS-specific tools like
.Xr dig 1 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Restrict the lookup to IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Restrict the lookup to IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl r
Ensure that a name is returned.
If no name can be resolved, an error is reported.
This is equivalent to the
.Dv NI_NAMEREQD
flag in
.Xr getnameinfo 3 .
.It Fl u
Use UDP instead of the default TCP.
This is equivalent to the
.Dv NI_DGRAM
flag in
.Xr getnameinfo 3 .
.It Fl f
Suppress the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).
This is equivalent to the
.Dv NI_NOFQDN
flag in
.Xr getnameinfo 3 .
.It Fl n
Display the numeric host address instead of resolving to a hostname.
This is equivalent to the
.Dv NI_NUMERICHOST
flag in
.Xr getnameinfo 3 .
.It Fl N
Display the numeric service name instead of resolving to a service name.
This is equivalent to the
.Dv NI_NUMERICSERV
flag in
.Xr getnameinfo 3 .
.It Fl H
Display only the hostname, omitting the service name.
.It Fl S
Display only the service name, omitting the hostname.
.It Fl p Ar port
Specify the port number to be used in the lookup.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std getnameinfo
.Sh EXAMPLES
Look up the hostname and service name for an IPv4 address:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ getnameinfo -4 -p 80 93.184.216.34
example.com http
.Ed
.Pp
Look up the numeric host and service for an IPv6 address:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ getnameinfo -nN -p 443 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946
2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 443
.Ed
.Pp
Resolve an address to its hostname but suppress the service name:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ getnameinfo -H -p 22 192.0.2.1
example-host
.Ed
.Pp
Resolve a hostname and service for a UDP connection:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ getnameinfo -u -p 53 198.51.100.2
example-dns-server domain
.Ed
