.Dt READLINK 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm readlink
.Nd display target of a symbolic link
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fnqsv
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays the target of a symbolic link.
If a given argument
.Ar file
is not a symbolic link and the
.Fl f
option is not specified,
.Nm readlink
will print nothing to standard output about that
.Ar file
and eventually exit with an error status.
If the
.Fl f
option is specified, the output is canonicalized by following every symlink
in every component of the given path recursively.
.Nm
will resolve both absolute and relative paths, and, if possible,
return the absolute pathname corresponding to
.Ar file .
In this case, the argument does not need to be a symbolic link.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl f
Canonicalize the pathname of
.Ar file ,
as described above.
.It Fl n
Do not force a newline to appear after the output for each
.Ar file .
.It Fl q
Suppress failure messages if calls to
.Xr lstat 2
fail.
This is the default for
.Nm readlink .
.It Fl s
This is an alternative to
.Fl q .
.It Fl v
Turn off quiet mode.
.Nm
will display errors about
.Ar file\^ Ns s
for which
.Xr lstat 2
fails, or without
.Fl f ,
which are not symbolic links.
This is the inverse of
.Fl q
and
.Fl s .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag
.It Ev POSIXLY_CORRECT
To obtain standards compliance, if
.Ev POSIXLY_CORRECT
is set in the environment, then
.Fl v
is the default, rather than
.Fl q .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
will exit with status 1 on a usage error,
or if any of the given
.Ar file
arguments do not exist, or if
.Fl f
is absent and any
.Ar file
arguments do not name symbolic links.
Otherwise
.Nm
exits with status 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr realpath 1 ,
.Xr stat 1 ,
.Xr lstat 2 ,
.Xr readlink 2
.Sh STANDARDS
.Nm
is expected to conform to
.St -p1003.1-2024 ,
provided it is run with
.Ev POSIXLY_CORRECT
set in its environment.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared along with
.Nm stat ,
within which it is integrated, in
.Nx 1.6 .
