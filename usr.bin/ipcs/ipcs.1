.Sh NAME
.Nm ipcs
.Nd report System V interprocess communication facilities status
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl abcmopqstMQST
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program provides information on System V interprocess communication
(IPC) facilities on the system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show the maximum amount of information possible when
displaying active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
(This is shorthand for specifying the
.Fl b ,
.Fl c ,
.Fl o ,
.Fl p ,
and
.Fl t
options.)
.It Fl b
Show the maximum allowed sizes for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
The
.Dq maximum allowed size
is the maximum number of bytes in a message on a message queue,
the size of a shared memory segment,
or the number of semaphores in a set of semaphores.
.It Fl c
Show the creator's name and group for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
.It Fl m
Display information about active shared memory segments.
.It Fl o
Show outstanding usage for active message queues,
and shared memory segments.
The
.Dq outstanding usage
is the number of messages in a message queue, or the number
of processes attached to a shared memory segment.
.It Fl p
Show the process ID information for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
The
.Dq process ID information
is the last process to send a message to or receive a message from
a message queue,
the process that created a semaphore, or the last process to attach
or detach a shared memory segment.
.It Fl q
Display information about active message queues.
.It Fl s
Display information about active semaphores.
.It Fl t
Show access times for active semaphores, message queues,
and shared memory segments.
The access times is the time
of the last control operation on an IPC object,
the last send or receive of a message,
the last attach or detach of a shared memory segment,
or the last operation on a semaphore.
.It Fl M
Display system information about shared memory.
.It Fl Q
Display system information about messages queues.
.It Fl S
Display system information about semaphores.
.It Fl T
Display system information about shared memory, message queues
and semaphores.
(This is shorthand for specifying the
.Fl M ,
.Fl Q ,
and
.Fl S
options.)
.El
.Pp
If none of the
.Fl M ,
.Fl m ,
.Fl Q ,
.Fl q ,
.Fl S ,
.Fl s ,
or
.Fl T
options are specified, information about all active IPC facilities is
listed.
.Pp
The output generated by
.Nm
if passed the
.Fl M ,
.Fl Q ,
and
.Fl S
options is self-explanatory.
For the other options, the output consists of a series
of columns depending on the facility in question as
well as which of the various supported flags were
given.
.Pp
The meaning of each column as identified by the column
heading is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 9n
.It Li T
The type of facility, identified as:
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent
.It Sy m
shared memory segment
.It Sy s
semaphore
.It Sy q
message queue
.El
.It Li ID
The identifier, suitable to be passed to, e.g.,
.Xr ipcrm 1 .
.It Li KEY
The key passed to, e.g.,
.Xr msgget 2 ,
.Xr semget 2 ,
or
.Xr shmget 2 ;
often created using
.Xr ftok 3 .
.It Li MODE
A string of 11 characters representing the access mode
and flags for the facility.
.Pp
On
.Nx ,
the first two characters are always
.Sy \- .
.Pp
The remaining 9 characters are similar to typical file
permissions in that three characters each refer to
owner-, group-, and other permissions of the facility
entry with the following meaning:
.Bl -tag -width 4n -offset indent
.It Sy r
read permission
.It Sy w
write permission
.It Sy a
alter permission; the ability to change control
information such as the owner or permissions
.El
.It Li OWNER
The user name (or, if no user name can be found, UID)
of the owner of the facility entry.
.It Li GROUP
The group name (or, if no group name can be found,
GID) of the group owner of the facility entry.
.It Li CREATOR
The user name (or, if no user name can be found, UID)
of the creator of the facility entry.
.It Li CGROUP
The group name (or, if no group name can be found,
GID) of the creator group owner of the facility entry.
.El
.Pp
Following this, the columns printed will differ for
each of the facilities.
.Pp
Times are displayed in
.Sy %H:%M:%S
format in the
time zone described by
.Pa /etc/localtime
or the
.Ev TZ
environment variable.
If no time is available for the given event, the
string "no-entry" is used instead.
.Ss Message Queues
.Bl -tag -width 9n
.It Li CBYTES
The total number of bytes left in the message queue.
.It Li QNUM
The number of messages left in the message queue.
.It Li QBYTES
The maximum number of bytes in the message queue.
.It Li LSPID
The process ID of the last process to send a message.
.It Li LRPID
The process ID of the last process to receive a
message.
.It Li STIME
The time of last
.Xr msgsend 2 .
.It Li RTIME
The time of last
.Xr msgrcv 2 .
.It Li CTIME
The time the message queue was created or last modified.
.El
.Ss Shared Memory
.Bl -tag -width 9n 
.It Li NATTCH
The number of current attaches.
.It Li SEGSZ
The size of the shared memory segment in bytes.
.It Li CPID
The process ID of the process that created the shared
memory segment.
.It Li LPID
The process ID of the last shm operation.
.It Li ATIME
The time of last
.Xr shmat 2 .
.It Li DTIME
The time of last
.Xr shmdt 2 .
.It Li CTIME
The time the shared memory segment was created
or last modified.
.El
.Ss Semaphores
.Bl -tag -width 9n
.It Li NSEMS
The number of semaphores in the set.
.It Li OTIME
The time of last
.Xr semop 2 .
.It Li CTIME
The time the semaphore set was created or last
modified.
.El
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
System data structures may change while
.Nm
is running; the output of
.Nm
is not guaranteed to be consistent.

.Sh BUGS
The first two characters of the
.Li MODE
are always set to
.Sy \-
on
.Nx .
On other platforms, these characters may indicate
additional state information about the given facility.
