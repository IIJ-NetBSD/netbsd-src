.Sh NAME
.Nm ldd
.Nd list dynamic object dependencies
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ov
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Ar program ...
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays all shared objects that are needed to run the given program.
Unlike
.Xr nm 1 ,
the list includes
.Dq indirect
dependencies that are the result of needed shared objects which themselves
depend on yet other shared objects.
.Pp
Zero, one or two
.Fl f
options may be given.
The argument is a format string that allows customization of
.Nm Ap s
output.
The first format argument is used for library objects and defaults to
.Ql \et-l%o.%m => %p\en .
The second format argument is used for non-library objects and defaults to
.Ql \et%o => %p\en .
.Pp
These arguments are interpreted as format strings a\~la
.Xr printf 3
to customize the trace output and allow
.Nm
to be operated as a filter more conveniently.
The following conversions can be used:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.
.It Li %a
The main program's name, either set from the
.Xr elf 5
auxiliary vector entry
.Dv AT_SUN_EXECNAME
passed from the kernel to rhe dynamic linker,
or from the first element of the argument vector.
.
.It Li \&%A \" NB: .%A is a mdoc macro name
The program name from the argument vector.
.
.It Li %o
The library name.
.
.It Li %m
The library's major version number.
.
.It Li %n
.Em Obsolete
.Pq a.out .
The library's minor version number,
expands to an empty string in
.Tn ELF .
.
.It Li %p
The full pathname as determined by
.Nm rtld Ap s
library search rules.
.
.It Li %x
The library's load address
.El
.Pp
Additionally,
.Ql \en
and
.Ql \et
are recognized and have their usual meaning.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
option is a shorthand to set the format for library objects to
.Ql %a:-l%o.%m => %p\en ,
which makes
.Nm
behave analogously to
.Ic nm Fl o .
It cannot be combined with
.Fl f .
.Pp
The
.Fl v
option turns on verbose mode.
.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Tn SunOS 4.0 .
It appeared in its current form in
.Nx 0.9a .
