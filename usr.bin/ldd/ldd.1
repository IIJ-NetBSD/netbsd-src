.Sh NAME
.Nm ldd
.Nd list dynamic object dependencies
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ov
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Ar program ...
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays all shared objects that are needed to run the given program.
Unlike
.Xr nm 1 ,
the list includes
.Dq indirect
dependencies that are the result of needed shared objects which themselves
depend on yet other shared objects.
.Pp
Zero, one or two
.Fl f
options may be given.
The argument is a format string that allows customization of
.Nm Ap s
output.
The first format argument is used for library objects and defaults to
.Ql \et-l%o.%m => %p\en .
The second format argument is used for non-library objects and defaults to
.Ql \et%o => %p\en .
.Pp
These arguments are interpreted as format strings a\~la
.Xr printf 3
to customize the trace output and allow
.Nm
to be operated as a filter more conveniently.
The following conversions can be used:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.
.It Li %a
The main program's absolute path,
constructed either from the exact argument passed to
.Nm
if it is an absolute path,
or having the current working directory prepended to it if not.
.
.It Li \&%A \" NB: .%A is a mdoc macro name
The program name from the argument vector.
.
.It Li %o
The library name.
.
.It Li %m
The library's major version number.
.
.It Li %n
.Em Obsolete
.Pq a.out .
The library's minor version number,
expands to an empty string in
.Tn ELF .
.
.It Li %p
The full pathname as determined by
.Nm rtld Ap s
library search rules.
.
.It Li %x
The library's load address
.El
.Pp
Additionally,
.Ql \en
and
.Ql \et
are recognized and have their usual meaning.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
option is a shorthand to set the format for library objects to
.Ql %a:-l%o.%m => %p\en ,
which makes
.Nm
behave analogously to
.Ic nm Fl o .
It cannot be combined with
.Fl f .
.Pp
The
.Fl v
option turns on verbose mode.
.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Tn SunOS 4.0 .
It appeared in its current form in
.Nx 0.9a .
