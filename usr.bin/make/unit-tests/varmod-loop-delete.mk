# Tests for the variable modifier ':@', which as a side effect allows to
# delete an arbitrary variable.

# A side effect of the modifier ':@' is that the loop variable is created as
# an actual variable in the current evaluation scope (Command/Global/target),
# and at the end of the loop, this variable is deleted.  Since var.c 1.204
# from 2016-02-18 and before var.c 1.963 from 2021-12-05, a variable could be
# deleted while it was in use, leading to a use-after-free bug.
#
# See Var_Parse, comment 'the value of the variable must not change'.
