.Sh NAME
.Nm vether
.Nd virtual Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device vether"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface simulates a normal Ethernet interface by encapsulating
standard network frames with an Ethernet header, specifically
for use as a member in a
.Xr bridge 4 .
.Pp
To use
.Nm
the administrator needs to configure an address onto the interface
so that packets can be routed to it.
An Ethernet header will be prepended and, if the
.Nm
interface is a member of a
.Xr bridge 4 ,
the frame will show up there.
.Pp
The
.Nm
link state can be controlled using
.Xr ifconfig 8 :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width Cm -compact
.It Cm media auto
link state
.Dq up
.It Cm media none
link state
.Dq down
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bridge 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Ox 4.7
and
.Nx 10 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Theo de Raadt Aq Mt deraadt@openbsd.org
.Sh BUGS
Like
.Xr tap 4 ,
the Ethernet address chosen will be partially random, and may
occasionally collide with another address.
