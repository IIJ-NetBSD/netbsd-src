.Sh NAME
.Nm akbd
.Nd Apple Desktop Bus keyboard driver for wscons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "akbd* at obio?"
.Cd "wskbd* at akbd? console ?"
.Pp
.Cd "options ALTXBUTTONS"
.Cd "options CAPS_IS_CONTROL"
.Cd "options FORCE_FUNCTION_KEYS"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides the
.Xr wscons 4
driver with support for Apple Desktop Bus keyboards.
.Pp
To work around the limited number of buttons found on most ADB mice,
one can map key sequences to trigger mouse button events.
To map Option+1, Option+2, Option+3 to mouse buttons 1, 2, and 3
respectively, add the following line to your kernel configuration
file:
.Pp
.Cd "options ALTXBUTTONS"
.Pp
On macppc systems it is possible to tweak the keyboard driver
to treat the caps lock key on an ADB keyboard as a control key.
This requires special remapping because of ADB's strange emulation of
a mechanically-locked key.  To enable this code add the following
line to your kernel configuration file:
.Pp
.Cd options CAPS_IS_CONTROL
.Pp
On macppc PowerBooks, several function keys double as "hot keys"
(brightness, volume, eject) when the Fn modifier is held down.
Mac OS X likes to reprogram the keyboard controller to send hot key
events when Fn is not held down and send function key events when it
is.
To transform the non-keyboard "button" events back into function key
events, place the following line in your kernel configuration file:
.Pp
.Cd options FORCE_FUNCTION_KEYS
.Pp
On PowerBook models holding Option and up/down arrows change the screen
brightness.
