.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options DKWEDGE_AUTODISCOVER"
.Cd "options DKWEDGE_METHOD_APPLE"
.Cd "options DKWEDGE_METHOD_BSDLABEL"
.Cd "options DKWEDGE_METHOD_GPT"
.Cd "options DKWEDGE_METHOD_MBR"
.Cd "options DKWEDGE_METHOD_RDB"
.Cd "options DKWEDGE_METHOD_TOS"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a disk-like interface, or
.Em wedge ,
to an area of a physical disk.
Wedges may be configured manually with
.Xr dkctl 8
or automatically by the kernel upon the attachment of the physical disk.
.Pp
Wedges need to have unique names.
If a duplicate name is detected during
auto-discovery, that partition is ignored.
.Sh KERNEL OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Dv
.\"
.It Dv DKWEDGE_AUTODISCOVER
Automatically detect and configure wedges using any available methods.
For each partition found, a wedge with a corresponding name is created.
.Pp
Currently only
.Dv DKWEDGE_METHOD_GPT
and
.Dv DKWEDGE_METHOD_APPLE
are enabled by default.
.\"
.It Dv DKWEDGE_METHOD_APPLE
Apple partition map detection method.
.\"
.It Dv DKWEDGE_METHOD_BSDLABEL
.Tn BSD
disklabel detection method.
For each configured partition in the
.Xr disklabel 5
that is not of type
.Dv FS_UNUSED ,
a wedge is created and named after the
.Fa d_packname
field followed by
.Ql \&/
and the partition letter
.Sm off
.So Li a Sc \&.. So Li p Sc .
.Sm on
.Pp
When the
.Fa d_packname
is empty or has the value
.Ql fictitious ,
the regular partition names
are used as wedge names, i.e. the device name, unit number and
partition letter, for example
.Ql wd0a .
.\"
.It Dv DKWEDGE_METHOD_GPT
Extensible Firmware Interface Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table
.Tn ( GPT )
detection method.
.Pp
For every GPT partition a wedge is created and named after the
partition label.
GPT partitions are UTF-16\(enencoded, this is converted into UTF-8.
If a partition has no label, its UUID is used instead.
.\"
.It Dv DKWEDGE_METHOD_MBR
IBM PC-compatible Master Boot Record
.Tn ( MBR )
partitioning detection method, with support for Extended MBRs.
.Pp
For every partition in the MBR a wedge is created and named like a
regular partition name, i.e. the device name, unit number and a
partition letter, for example
.Ql wd0e .
Primary partitions start with
.Ql e ,
extended partitions start with
.Ql i .
.\"
.It Dv DKWEDGE_METHOD_RDB
Amiga Rigid Disk Block
.Tn ( RDB )
partitioning detection method.
.\"
.It Dv DKWEDGE_METHOD_TOS
Atari's
.Tn TOS
partition map detection method, for disks that conform to Atari's AHDI
specification.
.Pp
For each partition, a wedge is created with a name of the format
.Sm off
.Li ATARI_ Bro Ar type Brc Li _ Bro Ar number Brc
.Sm on
where
.Ar type
may either be
.Ql GEM
or
.Ql BGM .
The first partition typically corresponds to the
.Ql C:
drive when read on an actual Atari, the second to
.Ql D:
and so on.
Extended partitions
.Pq those of type Ql XGM
are not currently supported.
