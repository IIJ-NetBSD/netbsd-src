.Sh NAME
.Nm umcpmio
.Nd Driver for Microchip Technologies MCP2221 / MCP2221A multi-io bridge.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "umcpmio* at uhidev? reportid ?"
.Cd "gpio* at gpiobus?"
.Cd "iic* at umcpmio?" or
.Cd "iic* at i2cbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the MCP2221 / MCP2221A multi-io bridge chip.
The chip provides 4 simple gpio pins with multiple functions
that attach as a
.Xr gpio 4
device, an I2C port that attaches as an
.Xr iic 4
device and a UART serial port that attaches using
.Xr umodem 4
as a normal
.Xr ucom 4
.Pa ttyU Ns Ar \&*
device.
The UART is presented as one USB function, while the GPIO and I2C pins
are presented as a second HID USB function.
.Ss GPIO
There are 4 basic gpio pins available with the following functions:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.TS
box tab(:);
l | l | l | l | l
= | = | = | = | =
l | l | l | l | l

ALT3:SSPND:Clock output:USBCFG:I2C activity
.TE
.Ed
.Pp
ADC1, ADC2 and ADC3 are independent of each other and each 10 bits in
length.
To utilize one of the ADC pins, an
.Xr open 2
is performed against
.Pa /dev/umcpmio0GP1 ,
.Pa /dev/umcpmio0GP2
or
.Pa /dev/umcpmio0GP3
with only the
.Dv O_RDONLY
flag set.
Reads against the open file descriptor will produce
.Vt uint16_t
values.
.Pp
There is actually only one DAC present in the chip, but it is mirrored
to GP2 and GP3 if the pin is set to ALT1.
The DAC is 5 bits in length, and to use it, an
.Xr open 2
is performed against
.Pa /dev/umcpmio0GP2
or
.Pa /dev/umcpmio0GP3
with only the
.Dv O_WRONLY
flag set.
Writes of
.Vt uint8_t
bytes to the file descriptor will result in an analog signal being
created on the output pin.
.Pp
The clock output is derived from the USB clock of 48MHz.
The duty cycle and clock divider can be adjusted with
.Xr sysctl 8
variables.
To utilize GP1 as the clock output, the ALT3 function can be set with
.Xr gpioctl 8
command.
.Ss I2C
The chip supports a hardware I2C port with a simple scripting engine.
When the driver attaches, the I2C speed is set to 100Kb/s.
The ability to perform an I2C READ without a STOP is not supported by
the MCP2221 / MCP2221A engine and the driver turns a READ without STOP
into a READ with STOP.
This behavior is just an attempt to allow a device to function, and it
may not work for any particular device.
In particular, it is known that the
.Xr ds2482ow 4
device will not work as expected.
.Pp
The MCP2221 / MCP2221A chip will automatically detact and deal with a
device that uses I2C clock stretching.
.Ss UART
The UART utilizes the
.Xr umodem 4
driver.
The UART function of the chip only supports
.Tn 8-N-1
communications.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following
.Xr sysctl 3
variables are provided:
.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Li -compact
.
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.debug
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.dump_buffers
If
.Dv UMCPMIO_DEBUG
is defined, additional debugging output can be enabled.
.
.Pp
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.response_wait
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.response_errcnt
This is how long the driver will wait for a HID response to come back
from the chip.
This variable is in microseconds and defaults to 2500.
The driver will only allow
.Li response_errcnt
number of errors when waiting for a reponse from a HID report.
This includes timeouts due to exceeding
.Li response_wait .
.
.Pp
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.i2c.reportreadnostop
Report on the console if a driver attempts to use an I2C READ without
STOP.
A READ without STOP is not supported by the MCP2221 / MCP2221A I2C
engine and will be turned into a READ with STOP by the driver.
.
.Pp
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.i2c.busy_delay
The driver checks in a number of cases if the I2C engine is busy and
will wait for
.Li busy_delay
microseconds before checking again.
.
.Pp
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.i2c.retry_busy_read
The number of times to try to do an I2C READ when the engine is busy.
.
.Pp
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.i2c.retry_busy_write
The number of times to try to do an I2C WRITE when the engine is busy.
.
.Pp
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.gpio.clock_duty_cycle
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.gpio.clock_divider
When GP1 is configured to use function ALT3, it will output a clock
pulse.
The valid values for
.Li clock_duty_cycle
are
.Ql 75% ,
.Ql 50% ,
.Ql 25% ,
and
.Ql \^0% .
That is, 75% of the time a high and 25% of the time a low will be
present on the GP1 pin.
The valid values for
.Li clock_divider
are
.Ql 375kHz ,
.Ql 750kHz ,
.Ql 1.5MHz ,
.Ql 3MHz ,
.Ql 6MHz ,
.Ql 12MHz ,
and
.Ql 24MHz .
.
.Pp
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.dac.vref
.It Li hw.umcpmio0.adc.vref
Sets the VREF value for the DAC or ADC.
The valid values are
.Ql 4.096V ,
.Ql 2.048V ,
.Ql 1.024V ,
.Ql OFF ,
and
.Ql VDD .
.
.El

IOCTLs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 11.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Brad Spencer Aq Mt brad@anduin.eldar.org .
.Sh BUGS
The gpio pins on the MCP2221 / MCP2221A are very slow and one should
not expect to be able to rapidly change their state.
Even if the problem mentioned below did not exist, one should not
expect to be able to use any of the gpio bit banger drivers such as
.Xr gpioiic 4
or
.Xr gpioow 4 .
.Pp
The interrupt function on GP1 cannot currently be used because it is
currently not possible to attach through the driver.
There may be two possible problems going on:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Xr gpio 4
framework runs at
.Dv IPL_VM
with a spin lock and when it attempts to establish an interrupt that
uses the gpio from
.Xr umcpmio 4 ,
calls are made into the USB stack that will want to wait in a way that
is not allowed while holding a spin lock.
.
.It
.Xr autoconf 9
runs with
.Dv KERNEL_LOCK
and during the attachment, this lock is held when calls are made into
the USB stack that will cause a wait that is not allowed while holding
.Dv KERNEL_LOCK .
.El
.
.Pp
Either or both of these may be
going on, but the end result is that the kernel will panic while
attempting to perform a USB transfer while another driver is
attempting to attach through
.Xr umcpmio 4 .
.Pp
Likewise, a
.Ql \|gpioctl gpio1 attach ...\|
type call will also panic for the same reason.
.Pp
The end result is that
.Xr gpioirq 4 ,
.Xr gpiopps 4
and
.Xr gpioow 4
will not work with the gpio from
.Xr umcpio 4 .
.Pp
Please note that the
.Xr umcpmio 4
driver itself can use the USB stack during attachment and there does
not appear to be any problems using the GPIO pins or setting GPIO pin
configurations.
It is only when the driver is a target during another driver's
attachment that there is a problem.
.Pp
The ability to set or change values in most of the chip's FLASH memory
is not supported.
This includes changing the configuration protection password.
Likewise, support for entering the configuration protection password
does not exist, should a particular chip have password protection
enabled.
