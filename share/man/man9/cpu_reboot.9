.Dt CPU_REBOOT 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu_reboot
.Nd halt or reboot the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/reboot.h
.Ft void
.Fn cpu_reboot "int howto" "char *bootstr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cpu_reboot
function handles final system shutdown, and either halts or reboots
the system.
The exact action to be taken is determined by the flags passed in
.Fa howto
and by whether or not the system has finished autoconfiguration.
.Pp
If the system has finished autoconfiguration,
.Fn cpu_reboot
does the following:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
Sets the
.Va boothowto
system variable (see
.Xr boothowto 9 )
from the
.Fa howto
argument.
.It
If this is the first invocation of
.Fn cpu_reboot
and the
.Dv RB_NOSYNC
flag is not set in
.Fa howto ,
syncs and unmounts the system disks by calling
.Xr vfs_shutdown 9
and sets the time of day clock by calling
.Xr resettodr 9 .
.It
Disables interrupts.
.It
If rebooting after a crash (i.e., if
.Dv RB_DUMP
is set in
.Fa howto ,
but
.Dv RB_HALT
is not), saves a system crash dump.
.It
Runs any shutdown hooks by calling
.Xr pmf_system_shutdown 9 .
.It
Prints a message indicating that the system is about to be halted
or rebooted.
.It
If
.Dv RB_HALT
is set in
.Fa howto ,
halts the system.
Otherwise, reboots the system.
.El
.Pp
If the system has not finished autoconfiguration,
.Fn cpu_reboot
runs any shutdown hooks by calling
.Xr pmf_system_shutdown 9 ,
prints a message, and halts the system.
.Pp
If
.Dv RB_STRING
is set in
.Pa howto ,
then the parameter
.Fa bootstr
is passed to the system boot loader on some ports.
