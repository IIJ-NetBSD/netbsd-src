.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm doshutdownhooks
.Nd run all shutdown hooks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void
.Fn doshutdownhooks "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em The
.Nm
.Em routine is deprecated.
.Em Use
.Xr pmf_system_shutdown 9
.Em instead.
.Pp
The
.Fn doshutdownhooks
function invokes all shutdown hooks established using the
.Xr shutdownhook_establish 9
function.
Shutdown hooks are called in reverse order, i.e.,
the shutdown hook established last will be called first.
.Pp
This function is called from
.Fn cpu_reboot
with interrupts turned off.
It is called immediately before the system is halted or rebooted,
after file systems have been unmounted, after the clock has been updated,
and after a system dump has been done (if necessary).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cpu_reboot 9 ,
.Xr shutdownhook_establish 9
