.Sh DESCRIPTION
The machine-independent
.Nm
interface provides lockless producer/consumer queues.
A queue
.Po
.Vt pcq_t
.Pc
allows multiple writers
.Pq producers ,
but only a single reader
.Pq consumer .
The consumer is expected to be protected by a lock that covers
the structure that the
.Vt pcq_t
is embedded into
.Po
e.g., socket lock, ifnet hwlock
.Pc .
These queues operate in a first-in, first-out
.Pq FIFO
manner.
The act of inserting or removing an item from a
.Vt pcq_t
does not modify the item in any way.
.Nm
does not prevent an item from being inserted multiple times into a single
.Vt pcq_t .
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn pcq_create "maxlen" "kmflags"
Create a queue that can store at most
.Fa maxlen
items at one time.
.Fa kmflags
should be either
.Dv KM_SLEEP ,
if
.Fn pcq_create
is allowed to sleep until resources are available, or
.Dv KM_NOSLEEP
if it should return
.Dv NULL
immediately, if resources are unavailable.
.It Fn pcq_destroy "pcq"
Free the resources held by
.Fa pcq .
.It Fn pcq_get "pcq"
Remove the next item to be consumed from the queue and return it.
If the queue is empty,
return
.Dv NULL .
The caller must prevent concurrent gets from occurring.
.It Fn pcq_maxitems "pcq"
Return the maximum number of items that the queue can store at
any one time.
.It Fn pcq_peek "pcq"
Return the next item to be consumed from the queue but do not remove
it from the queue.
If the queue is empty,
return
.Dv NULL .
.It Fn pcq_put "pcq" "item"
Place an item at the end of the queue.
If there is no room in the queue for the item, return
.Dv false ;
otherwise, return
.Dv true .
The item must not have the value of
.Dv NULL .
.El
.Ss Memory ordering
Any memory operations sequenced before
.Fn pcq_put
of an item in one thread happen before all memory operations with data
dependencies on the item returned by
.Fn pcq_get
or
.Fn pcq_peek
in another thread.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int mumble;

/* producer */
mumble = 42;			// A
foo->x = 123;			// B
refcnt = foo->refcnt;		// C
pcq_put(pcq, foo);
KASSERT(refcnt == 0);

/* consumer */
foo = pcq_get(pcq);
if (foo == NULL)
	return;
atomic_inc_uint(&foo->refcnt);	// D
x = foo->x;			// E
if (x == 123)
	KASSERT(mumble == 42);	// F
.Ed
.Pp
In this example, memory operations B and C happen-before D and E.
However, no ordering is guaranteed for A or F relative to any other
memory operations, because the memory location of
.Fa mumble
is independent of the pointer
.Fa foo
returned by
.Fn pcq_get .
.Pp
If you must guarantee A happens before F, then on the consumer side,
after
.Fn pcq_get
or
.Fn pcq_peek ,
you can call
.Fn membar_acquire
to turn it into an acquire operation instead of a consume operation;
.Fn pcq_put
serves as the matching release operation.
.Po
This is a little dicey.
Perhaps there should be separate
.Fn pcq_peek_acq
and
.Fn pcq_get_acq
operations if this semantics is necessary.
