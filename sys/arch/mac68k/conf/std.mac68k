# All 68k Macs that NetBSD runs on have a Motorola MMU.  For 68030 and 68040,
# this is inferred from the CPU.  But if the kernel only includes support for
# 68020, we have to be explicit about it.
#
# XXX config(1) needs something like this:
#
# ifoption M68020: M68K_MMU_68851
options 	M68K_MMU_MOTOROLA

options 	HZ=60			# mac clock runs at 60hz
