NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE WII BOOTLOADER HERE.  The format of this
file is important - make sure the entries are appended on end, last item
is taken as the current.

1.0:	Initial version.
1.1:	When the EJECT button is pressed during boot, the default kernel
	filenames "netbsd" and "netbsd.gz" are skipped. Backup kernels
	starting with "onetbsd" and "onetbsd.gz" are used instead. The
	RESET button will now reset the system when ppcboot.elf is in
	panic state.
