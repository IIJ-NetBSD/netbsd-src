$NetBSD: README,v 1.2 2025/04/17 13:08:55 gdt Exp $

This directory contains kernel source for NPF, the NetBSD Packet
Filter, but the README also applies to:

  src/lib/npf: library for interacting with in-kernel npf
    implementation

  src/usr.bin/npf: tools for configuring in-kernel npf and for testing

  assorted supporting files (rc.d, modules, tests)

Previously, NetBSD considered https://github.com/rmind/npf/ to be the
upstream location.  There is no obligation to file PRs when changing
npf in NetBSD.  Please avoid unecessary divergence in order to ease
future syncing from this repo, but this caution should not block
improvements.
