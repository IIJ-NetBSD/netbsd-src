# This file contains all generally useful virtio(4) drivers.
# It is suitable for inclusion in a kernel config(5) file which
# provides any virtio(4) attachments, typically at pci, fdt, or acpi.
#
# Note: Certain drivers currently need PAGE_SIZE == VIRTIO_PAGE_SIZE:
# - viomb
# - vio9p
# These may have to be disabled explicitly in users on architectures
# where PAGE_SIZE != 4096.
