.Sh NAME
.Nm worms
.Nd animate worms on a display terminal
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ft
.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl S Ar seed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Ux
version of the DEC-2136 program
.Dq worms .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d Ar delay
Specifies a
.Ar delay ,
in milliseconds, between each update.
This is useful for fast terminals.
Reasonable values are around 20-200;
the default is 20.
.It Fl f
Makes a
.Dq field
for the worm(s) to eat.
.It Fl l Ar length
Specifies the
.Ar length
of each worm; the default is 16, the minimum is 2.
.It Fl n Ar number
Specifies the
.Ar number
of worms; the default is 3.
There must be at least one.
.It Fl S Ar seed
Provide an integer
.Ar seed
for the random number generator.
Specifying zero (0, the default) causes a random seed to be used.
.It Fl t
Makes each worm leave a trail behind it.
.El
.Pp
The maximum
.Ar length ,
and
.Ar number ,
of worms depends upon the screen size, though the
.Ar length
can never exceed 1024.
If the screen is particularly small, even the defaults
for those may be too large.
Screens with less than 3 rows or columns cannot be handled,
nor can ones with insufficient total space.
