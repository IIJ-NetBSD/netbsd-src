.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility interacts with a Microchip Technology EMC-210x or EMC-230x fan controller via
.Xr emcfan 4
driver.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d Ar debug mode
.It Fl j Ar for the commands that produce output, output the result in JSON
.It Fl h Ar displays help
.El
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar info
Print the family, chip id and chip revision for the specific device.
.It Ar register list
Print the valid registers for the particular chip at the specific device.
.It Ar register read start_register [end_register]
Print the values present in the range of registers from start_register to
end_register.  If end_register is missing, just print one register at
start_register.  It is possible to use the text names given out by the list
command for start_register or end_register.
.It Ar register write a_register value
Write value into the register called a_register.
.El
.Pp
The EMC210X and EMC230X fan controllers have a tremendous number of
features and options and can run in number of different modes.
What follows are some short cut commands that can be used for some of
the more common things one might want to do with a particular
controller.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar fan <n> status
Print the stall, spin up and drive status for a particular fan.  Note
that the fan will be marked as stalled if the RPMs are below the
minumum expected RPM level.
.It Ar fan <n> drive read
Print the current value of the drive level for a particular fan.
.It Ar fan <n> drive write value
Set the drive level for a particular fan to value.
.It Ar fan <n> divider read
Print the current value of the frequency divider for a particular fan.
.It Ar fan <n> drive write value
Set the frequency divider for a particular fan to value.
.It Ar fan <n> drive min_expected_rpm read
Print the current minimum expected RPM that a fan is suppose to run
at.
If the RPMs are lower than the expected value, the fan will be
marked as stalled and the RPM value in
.Xr envstat 8
will be N/A.
.It Ar fan <n> drive min_expected_rpm write 500|1000|2000|4000
Set the minimum expected RPM value for a fan.
.It Ar fan <n> drive edges read
Print the number of edges that a particular fan has.
This value, along with hw.emcfan0.poles, is used in the tachometer
algorithm to determine the RPM.
.It Ar fan <n> drive edges write 3|5|7|9
Set the number of edges that the fan has.
.It Ar fan <n> polarity read
.It Ar fan <n> polarity inverted
.It Ar fan <n> polarity non-inverted
Print or set the polarity of the drive level for the fan.
When the polarity is inverted a drive level of 0 will be maximum
drive, and when the polarity is non-inverted, a drive level of 0 is
minimum drive.
.It Ar fan <n> drive pwm_base_frequency read
Print the number of PWM base frequency for a particular fan.
.It Ar fan <n> drive pwm_base_frequency write 26000|19531|4882|2441
Set the base PWM frequency for a particular fan.
.It Ar fan <n> pwm_output_type read
.It Ar fan <n> pwm_output_type push-pull
.It Ar fan <n> pwm_output_type open-drain
Print or set the PWM output type for a particular fan.
.It Ar apd read
.It Ar apd on
.It Ar apd off
Print, turn on or turn off the anti-parallel diode mode on the chip.
The EMC2103-2/4, EMC2104 and EMC2106 have the ability to connect two
temperature sensor diodes together with just two wires.
In order to be able to read both diodes, APD needs to be turned on.
.It Ar smbus_timeout read
.It Ar smbus_timeout on
.It Ar smbus_timeout off
Print, turn on or turn off SMBUS timeout.
I2C and SMBUS are very simular, but a difference is that SMBUS clients
can trigger a bus timeout if operations are not performed against the
chip in a certain amount of time.
In order to be completely I2C compliant, the SMBUS timeout should be
turned off.
Some of the EMC product default this to on and some default it to off.
.El
.Pp
Not all of the above options apply to all chip types and the
.Nm
command will error if the option does not apply to a particular device.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
This will print the chip family and product id for a particular device.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 info"
.Bd -literal
Product Family: EMC230x
Chip name: EMC2301
Revision: 1
.Pp
This is the same, except in JSON.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl -j /dev/emcfan0 info | json_pp"
.Bd -literal
{
   "chip_name" : "EMC2301",
   "family_name" : "EMC230x",
   "product_family" : 2,
   "product_id" : 55,
   "revision" : 1
}
.Pp
This reads a number of registers from the chip and output the result
in a JSON array.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl -j /dev/emcfan0 register read 0x20 0x29 | json_pp"
.Bd -literal
[
   {
      "register" : 32,
      "register_name" : "configuration",
      "register_value" : 64
   },
   {
      "register" : 36,
      "register_name" : "fan_status",
      "register_value" : 0
   },
   {
      "register" : 37,
      "register_name" : "fan_stall_status",
      "register_value" : 0
   },
   {
      "register" : 38,
      "register_name" : "fan_spin_status",
      "register_value" : 0
   },
   {
      "register" : 39,
      "register_name" : "drive_fail_status",
      "register_value" : 0
   },
   {
      "register" : 41,
      "register_name" : "fan_interrupt_enable_register",
      "register_value" : 0
   }
]
.Pp
You can use names for the registers.  The following produces the same
result as the previous example, except not in JSON.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 register read configuration drive_fail_status"
.Bd -literal
configuration;32 (0x20);64 (0x40)
fan_status;36 (0x24);0 (0x00)
fan_stall_status;37 (0x25);0 (0x00)
fan_spin_status;38 (0x26);0 (0x00)
drive_fail_status;39 (0x27);0 (0x00)
.Pp
This writes a uint8_t value to a particular register.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 register write configuration 0xc0"
.Pp
This read back the 0x20 register, also known as "configuration" as a
JSON array.  Using the jq command the value is extracted.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl -j /dev/emcfan0 register read 0x20 | jq -r '.[0].register_value'"
.Bd -literal
192
.Pp
Read the current drive level for fan #1 on a particular device.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 fan 1 drive read"
.Pp
.Bd -literal
Drive:96
.Pp
Change the drive level for fan #1.  A number of other variables effect
such as polarity and the PWM divider effect what the drive level
means.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 fan 1 drive write 0x80"
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 fan 1 drive read"
.Bd -literal
Drive:128
.Pp
If the envstat command is used to look at the RPM of a fan, it will
produce something like the following
.Bd -literal
                    Current  CritMax  WarnMax  WarnMin  CritMin  Unit
[emcfan0]
           FAN 1:      1159                                       RPM
.Pp
This is below the minumum expected RPM that the fan is suppose to run at.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 fan 1 min_expected_rpm read"
.Bd -literal
Minumum expected rpm:500
.Pp
If the minimum expected RPM is changed to be higher than what the fan
is able to run at, that will simulate a stalled fan.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 fan 1 min_expected rpm write 4000"
.Pp
Using the envstat command again should produce the following if the
fan is not able to run at 4000 RPM.
.Bd -literal
                    Current  CritMax  WarnMax  WarnMin  CritMin  Unit
[emcfan0]
           FAN 1:       N/A
.Pp
The fan will be marked as having stalled.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 fan 1 status"
.Bd -literal
Stalled: Yes
Spin up failed: No
Drive failed: No
.Pp
The minimum expected RPM should be set to just below the lowest value
that the fan is expected to run at.  The minumum expected RPM effects
the accuracy of the tachometers and should be as high as it can be
made while still producing usable RPM values.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 fan 1 min_expected rpm write 500"
.Pp
Using the envstat command again
.Pp
.Bd -literal
                    Current  CritMax  WarnMax  WarnMin  CritMin  Unit
[emcfan0]
           FAN 1:      1176                                       RPM
.Pp
The fan is not marked as having stalled.
.Pp
.Dl "emcfanctl /dev/emcfan0 fan 1 status"
.Bd -literal
Stalled: No
Spin up failed: No
Drive failed: No
