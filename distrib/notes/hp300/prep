There are two installation tools available.
The traditional miniroot
installer is script-based and may be netbooted or may be dumped to a disk
and run locally.
The ramdisk kernel with the
.Ic sysinst
installation utility is more flexible,
but can only be netbooted and has not been extensively tested.
.Pp
There are several possible installation configurations described in this
document.
Other configurations are possible, but less common.
If you are unable to install based on the information in this document,
post a message to
.Mt port-hp300@NetBSD.org
asking for help.
The configurations described in this document are as follows:
.Pp
.(bullet -compact
\*M netboots
.Li SYS_UBOOT
from a
.Nx
server running
.Xr rbootd 8 ,
or other server platforms (Linux, FreeBSD, SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX etc.) with
YAMAMORI Takenori's
.Li sun-rbootd
package and then runs the miniroot installation tools or a purely diskless
installation from a server on the same subnet (you must have root access).
For more information, refer to the NetBSD Diskless
HOW-TO at
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/docs/network/netboot/
and
.Lk https://www.NetBSD.org/docs/network/netboot/rbootd/
.Pp
.It
\*M loads
.Li SYS_UBOOT
from a local disk, tape, or floppy
and then runs the miniroot installation tools or a purely diskless
installation from a server as described above.
You will need
.Tn HP-UX
on your \*M if it does not have a SCSI interface or a floppy drive.
.Pp
.It
\*M loads
.Li SYS_INST
from a local disk.
You partition the drive
and then run the miniroot installation tools from that drive.
You will need
.Tn HP-UX
on your \*M if it does not have a SCSI interface.
.bullet)
The preferred method is to use another
.Nx
server to netboot the \*M client.
This procedure will not
work on the handful of models which are incapable of netbooting.
In particular, the 320, 350, 330, 318, and
319 might not have a recent enough BootROM.
The BootROM revision is printed when your workstation is first powered on
(or rebooted).
Revision B or later will definitely work.
BootROMs with numeric revisions such as 1.1 (on a 400s) will netboot
without any problems.
You can netboot from any built-in or add-on ethernet board on
a model with a supported BootROM.
.Pp
If you have access to a
.Nx*M
system, it is
.Em much
easier to simply upgrade than to install from scratch.
Skip down to the section on
.Sx Upgrading a previously-installed NetBSD System
.
.Ss2 Formatting your hard drives
.
.Nx*M
does not have the capability to perform a low-level format of hard
drives.
SCSI disks can be formatted on any platform with SCSI support and
then used on
.Nx*M .
HP-IB disks can only be formatted by the
.Tn HP-UX
.Xr mediainit 1
command.
You may need to first create the device nodes for your disk, as
.Tn HP-UX
was never very good about populating
.Pa /dev/rdsk
properly.
.(disp
.No # Ic "mknod /dev/dsk/IDs0 b 0 0xSCID00"
.No # Ic "mknod /dev/rdsk/IDs0 c 4 0xSCID00"
.No # Ic "mediainit -v /dev/rdsk/IDs0"
.disp)
.(item
.Em ID
is the HP-IB address (a.k.a. slave) of the disk in hexadecimal.
This is usually between
.Li 00
and
.Li 07 ,
but possibly up to
.Li 1F
(31 decimal) .
.item)
.(item
.Em SC
is the Select Code of the disk controller.
This is usually
.Li 07
for slow (i.e. built-in) HP-IB or
.Li 0E
(14 decimal) for SCSI or fast HP-IB.
.item)
.
.Ss2 Designing your disk's partition table
.
This step can sometimes be a real pain, especially when using
.Pa SYS_INST .
It's best to calculate it ahead of time.
.Pp
If you are installing to an HP-IB disk,
you will need information about your disk's geometry, based on 512-byte sectors.
The file
.Pa installation/misc/HP-IB.geometry
in the distribution has geometry information for
several HP-IB disks, but may be incomplete.
Geometry may be calculated from an HP-UX
.Pa /etc/disktab
entry, but note that HP-UX geometry is based
on 1024 byte sectors, while
.Nx Ns 's
is based on 512 byte sectors.
You should have all partitions start on cylinder boundaries.
.Pp
If you are installing to a SCSI disk, you don't need to worry about the
details of the geometry.
Just create a disklabel based on the total
number of sectors available on the disk.
.Pp
.Em A quick note about partitions:
Since the target disk will become the boot
disk for your new
.Nx*M
installation, you will need to treat the
.Sq Li a
and
.Sq Li c
partitions in a special manner.
Due to the size of the
.Nx*M
boot program (it spills into the area after the disklabel),
it is necessary to offset the beginning of the
.Sq Li a
partition.
For HP-IB disks, it is best to offset it by one cylinder from
the beginning of the disk.
For SCSI disks, just offset it by 100 KB (200 sectors).
Later, the
.Sq Li c
partition will be marked with the type
.Sq Li boot
and may not be used for a file system.
(For those unfamiliar
with historic
.Bx
partition conventions, the
.Sq Li c
partition is defined as the
.Sq entire disk ,
or the
.Sq raw partition . )
.Pp
.(Note
You will need at least a 6 MB swap partition (although 2-3*RAM is
recommended) if you are unable to netboot the installer, as the miniroot
is temporarily placed in this partition.
.Note)
.Pp
Here is an example disklabel from a 7959B HP-IB hard drive:
.(disp
# /dev/rrd0a:
type: HP-IB
disk: rd7959B
label:
flags:
bytes/sector: 512

interleave: 1
trackskew: 0
cylinderskew: 0
headswitch: 0           # milliseconds
track-to-track seek: 0  # milliseconds
drivedata: 0

8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:    37800      378    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   #
  b:    66150    38178      swap     1024  8192    16   #
  c:   594216        0      boot                        # (Cyl.    0 - 1571)
  d:   489888   104328    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   #
.disp)
.
.Ss2 Installing the bootstrap program locally
.
For earlier models incapable of netbooting, you need to install the
bootstrap program on a bootable local device, such as a hard disk, floppy
disk, or tape drive.
If you will be booting the miniroot over the
network, then you will be installing
.Pa installation/misc/SYS_UBOOT .
.Pp
If you do not have access to a netboot server to serve the miniroot
installer, you can use a primitive bootstrap program
.Pa installation/misc/SYS_INST
to load the miniroot from a locally attached device (such as a
disk, tape or CD-R).
This is not recommended, as
.Pa SYS_INST
is difficult to use, buggy, and provides no error checking when
partitioning your disk.
.Pp
If your system has SCSI, this is easy.
Just take a scratch SCSI disk (hard disk, zip disk, or CD-R)
and use any computer to dump the bootstrap program to it.
For example, to dump it to the
.Li sd1
disk on a non-i386 platform:
.(disp
.No # Ic "dd if=SYS_UBOOT of=/dev/sd1c"
.disp)
.Pp
If your system has a floppy drive, you can write the bootstrap program to
it using any computer with a floppy drive.
You will need to dump it using a utility like
.Ic rawrite
or
.Xr dd 1 .
Make sure to read back from the floppy to verify that the file has been
written correctly.
.Pp
If your system does not have SCSI or a floppy drive, you will need a
bootable operating system on your \*M so you can write files to the HP-IB
device.
You should probably write the bootstrap program to the disk you
will be installing
.Nx
onto.
.Pp
Using
.Tn HP-UX
to write to an HP-IB disk:
.(disp
.No # Ic "dd if=SYS_UBOOT of=/dev/rdsk/IDs0"
.disp)
.(item
.Em ID
is the HP-IB address (a.k.a. slave) of the disk in hexadecimal.
This is usually between
.Li 00
and
.Li 07 ,
but possibly up to
.Li 1F
(31 decimal) .
.item)
.Pp
Using
.Tn HP-UX
to write to an HP-IB tape:
.(disp
.No # Ic "dd if=SYS_UBOOT of=/dev/rmt/0mnb obs=20b conv=osync"
.disp)
.
.Ss2 Installing the miniroot file system locally
.
This step is only necessary if you are not loading the miniroot
installer from a netboot server.
Follow the same procedure for the bootstrap program, except use the
uncompressed miniroot file system
.No ( Pa installation/miniroot/miniroot.fs.gz No )
instead of the bootstrap program.
The only quirk is that you should place it at the offset of the swap
partition you calculated above in the disklabel.
In the example disklabel above, the offset is 38178 sectors of 512 bytes.
Therefore, the
.Xr dd 1
command would be something like:
.(disp
.No # Ic "gunzip miniroot.fs.gz"
.No # Ic "dd if=miniroot.fs of=/dev/rdsk/IDs0 seek=38178b"
.disp)
Note the
.Sq Li b
after the offset, which specifies blocks of 512 bytes.
.Pp
By dumping the miniroot to disk where the swap partition will be, you're
saving a step later where
.Pa SYS_INST
tries to download the miniroot over NFS.
Just make sure that when you enter the partition table into
.Pa SYS_INST
you use the same block offset for the swap partition as you dumped the
miniroot.
.
.Ss2 Configuring the netboot server
.
This step will configure your netboot server to provide
.Pa SYS_UBOOT
and the miniroot installer to your \*M.
.Pp
.so ../common/netboot
.
.Ss2 Put Series 400 systems in "HP-UX Compatible Boot Mode"
.
Series 400 systems can be configured to boot either
.Tn HP-UX
or
.Tn DomainOS .
To boot
.Nx*M
you must have your system configured in
.Sq Li "HP-UX Compatible Boot Mode" .
If, when you power on your machine, it does
.Em not
present a menu like the following, then you need to change your
configuration.

.Ss2 Searching for a bootable system
.
All the early hp300 Boot ROMs are very primitive and only allow a few
simple operations.
You can only interact with it after it is first powered on.
If you reboot the machine, it will ignore anything you type and
start loading the same OS you previously booted.
.Pp
At any time after it recognizes the keyboard, while it is doing its self
test or searching for a bootable system, you can hit reset to return it to
a cold-boot configuration.
On HIL keyboards, this is
.Key control-shift-break ,
where
.Key break
is the key in the upper left (where
escape is on sane keyboards).
There is no equivalent over serial terminal,
you'll need to power-cycle your machine.
.Pp
After it beeps (i.e. recognizes the HIL keyboard), press
.Key RETURN
twice to get the list of bootable devices.

You should see your bootstrap program somewhere in this list.
If it's not here, then your \*M can't boot it and there's a problem somewhere.
To boot from a particular device, type in the two character name for it
and press
.Key RETURN .
In this example, you'd type
.Key 2Z
to boot from the network.
.
.Ss2 Selecting ethernet port on Series 400
.
Series 400 machines have two ethernet media types built into the
motherboard.
You may only use one at a time.
When your Series 400 workstation goes through the self-test when
powered on or rebooted, it will say one of the following:
.(disp
HP98643 (LAN) at 21, AUI
HP98643 (LAN) at 21, Thin
.disp)
.Pp
If the wrong type of network is selected, you will need to change the
ethernet port.
You will need to open the case (4XXt, 4XXdl, 4XXe) or
remove the motherboard (4XXs) to access the jumper.
Be sure to use static-prevention measures, as you could easily fry
your motherboard from carelessness.
If you are uncomfortable with this, ask a friend who is
aware of these issues.
There is a block of 8 jumpers at the rear of the
motherboard, labeled AUI/Thin.
You will need to put the jumpers in the
position necessary for your type of ethernet.
.
.Ss2 Running SYS_INST
.
This step is necessary
.Em only
if you cannot netboot.
.Pp
Chose
.Li SYS_INST
from the list of bootable devices that the BootROM found.
.Li SYS_INST
will load and prompt you for a command.
.Pp
.Em A quick note about disk numbers:
While in the
.Pa SYS_INST
program, you may use different unit numbers for the disks than when the
.Nx
kernel is running.
The unit number for a disk while in
.Pa SYS_INST
is calculated with the following formula:
.Pp
.(disp
unit = (controller * 8) + slaveID
.disp)
.Pp
Controllers are numbered 0, 1, ... starting with the lowest select code.
SCSI controllers and HP-IB controllers are counted separately.
Therefore,
if you had a system with an internal HP-IB interface at select code 7,
a fast HP-IB interface at select code 14, and a SCSI interface at select
code 16, unit numbers might be something like the following:
.Bl -column -offset indent HP-IB\ at\ 14,\ slaveID\ 5 Unit (disk:\ rd13)
.It Sy Location Ta Sy Unit
.It HP-IB\ at\ 7,\ slaveID\ 2 Ta 2 Ta (disk:\ rd2)
.It HP-IB\ at\ 14,\ slaveID\ 5 Ta 13 Ta (disk:\ rd13)
.It SCSI\ at\ 16,\ slaveID\ 0 Ta 0 Ta (disk:\ sd0)
.El
.Pp
You will need to place a disklabel on the disk.
.Pp
.(disp
.No "sys_inst\*[Gt]" Ic disklabel
.disp)
.(Note
It may be worth selecting the
.Sy zap
option initially to ensure that
the disklabel area is clear.
This may be especially important if an
HP-UX boot block had been previously installed on the disk.
.Note)
.Pp
Select the
.Sy edit
option, and answer the questions about your disk.
There may be several questions which you may not be sure of the answers to.
Listed below are guidelines for SCSI and HP-IB disks:
.Pp
.Bl -column -offset indent -compact Track-to-track?xx xxxxx
.It Bad\ sectoring? Ta NO
.It Ecc? Ta NO
.It Interleave? Ta 1
.It Trackskew? Ta 0
.It Cylinderskew? Ta 0
.It Headswitch? Ta 0
.It Track-to-track? Ta 0
.It Drivedata\ 0-4? Ta 0\ (for\ all\ Drivedata\ values)
.El
.Pp
Next, you will be asked to fill out the partition map.
You must provide responses for all 8 partitions.
Remember, you must have the sector offset for the
.Sq Li b
partition match the location you dumped the miniroot file system image.
Set the size and
offset of any unused partition to 0.
Note that sizes and offsets are expressed in
.Sq n sectors ,
assuming 512 byte sectors.
Care should be taken
to ensure that partitions begin and end on cylinder boundaries (i.e. size
and offset is an even multiple of the number of sectors per cylinder).
While this is not technically necessary, it is generally encouraged.
.Pp
.(Note
When setting the partition type of the
.Sq Li b
partition, make sure to
specify it as an
.Li ffs
partition so that the miniroot can be mounted (even
if this will be a swap partition).
You will be given a chance to clean
this up later in the installation process.
.Note)
.Pp
Once you have edited the label, select the
.Sy show
option to verify that it is correct.
If so, select
.Sy write
and
.Sy done .
Otherwise, you may re-edit the label.
.Pp
In an earlier step, we already copied the miniroot image to the target
disk.
.Pp
Boot from the miniroot file system.
.Pp
.(disp
.No "sys_inst\*[Gt]" Ic boot
.disp)
.Pp
Enter the disk from which to boot.
The kernel in the miniroot file system will be booted into single-user mode.
.
.Ss2 Choosing a kernel location
.
Once the bootstrap program
.Li SYS_UBOOT
has started, it will pause and let you chose a kernel location, name, and
options:
.(disp
\*[Gt]\*[Gt] NetBSD/hp300 Primary Boot, Revision 1.13
\*[Gt]\*[Gt] (gregm@mcgarry, Mon Apr 15 08:46:32 NZST 2002)
\*[Gt]\*[Gt] HP 9000/425e SPU
\*[Gt]\*[Gt] Enter "reset" to reset system.
Boot: [[[le0a:]netbsd][-a][-c][-d][-s][-v][-q]] :-
.disp)
.Pp
If your kernel is on a different device than
.Li SYS_UBOOT
then you will need to type in where to find it.
This is the case, for
example, if your model is incapable of netbooting and you started
.Li SYS_UBOOT
from a floppy, and the miniroot installer is on a netboot server.
In this case, you'd type in
.Sq Li le0
at the prompt.
.Pp
If you've installed the miniroot on your disk, you can always boot from
that by using partition
.Sq Li b
when prompted by
.Li SYS_UBOOT .
For example, to boot the miniroot from an HP-IB disk on controller 0 at
slave ID 2, you'd type:
.(disp
.No "Boot: [[[rd0a:]netbsd][-a][-c][-d][-s][-v][-q]] :- " Ic "rd2b:netbsd"
.disp)
